Bad news continues to come out regarding the new convention center, with <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/many-convention-center-contracts-rise-above-early-estimates\" target=\"_blank\">a total of four contracts spilling tens of thousands of dollars (or hundreds of thousands, in some cases) over the initial budget</a>. In addition to the PR contract with McNeely Piggot &amp; Fox and the consulting costs for the convention center hotel, the <em>City Paper</em> has identified two more contracts for financial consulting and building management consulting that have carried an unexpectedly hefty price tag. Altogether, these contracts add up to $1.93 million when they were originally capped at $587,000.</p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Metro police <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/electric-bill-tips-elaborate-marijuana-grow-operation\" target=\"_blank\">busted a giant marijuana grow operation in West Nashville thanks to the suspect&#x2019;s astronomical electricity bills</a>. A tipster first tipped off the police, and when investigators found that the bills were three times higher than surrounding homes in order to power the magical pot-growing lights, they were able to make the bust.</li><li>Councilwoman Pam Murray, who some East Nashvillians are trying to remove from office, thinks that all of the efforts are unfair.
