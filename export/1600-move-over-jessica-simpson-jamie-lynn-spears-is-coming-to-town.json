But the latest news from <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b103491_yeehaw_jamie_lynn_spears_goes_country.html\" target=\"_blank\">E! Online</a> is that Jamie Lynn Spears, Britney Spears&#x2019; mini-me, has been in town recording some demos for her new country album. Jamie Lynn Spears is known for her leading role on Nickelodeon&#x2019;s Zoey 101, and received a lot of attention last year upon becoming a teenage mother, yet has never pursued music as a career (so we can&#x2019;t really speculate on this quite yet).&#xA0;We&#x2019;re now taking bets on who the next random celebrity to show up to record some country hits in Nashville will be.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo from </em><a href=\"http://images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/20070921/293.spears.jamie.lynn.092107.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><em>E!
