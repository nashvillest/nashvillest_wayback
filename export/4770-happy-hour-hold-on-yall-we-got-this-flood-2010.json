Here&#x2019;s some of the latest news from around the midstate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>President Obama <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/2010-flood/president-declares-disasters-across-state-opening-lines-federal-aid?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">finally declared us a disaster area, meaning that flood victims are now eligible to receive FEMA aid.</a> To apply, call (800) 621-FEMA.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/2010-flood/rumors-water-shutoff-are-false-city-says?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">rumors of the city shutting off water are absolutely untrue</a>. Don&#x2019;t believe your Facebook friends, don&#x2019;t believe your coworkers, don&#x2019;t believe your neighbors&#x2026; <a href=\"http://coolpeoplecare.org/feature/what-one-half-looks-like/\" target=\"_blank\">just conserve</a>. Easy enough, right?</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12425775\" target=\"_blank\">And by &#x201C;conserve&#x201D; we mean don&#x2019;t panic and fill your bathtub</a>. Be smart about it and use as much bottled water as you can in place of tap water.</li>\n<li>Metro Schools are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12426184\" target=\"_blank\">closed tomorrow for the third day straight</a>, and they <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/2010-flood/schools-closed-wednesday-may-not-have-make-flood-days?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">may not have to make up the days</a>.</li>\n<li>Four teens were rescued after going missing earlier in Williamson County <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/2010-flood/teens-pulled-harpeth-river-were-crying-babies?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">after trying to go canoeing in the Harpeth River</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12423254\" target=\"_blank\">Power will probably be out in parts of downtown</a> through the end of the week. NES is trying hard, but they can&#x2019;t do much until the water recedes.</li>\n<li>Public health officials are a little <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12425485\" target=\"_blank\">concerned about the effects contamination in the floodwaters</a>.</li>\n<li>MTA and RTA will <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12413202\" target=\"_blank\">resume bus service starting Thursday on a limited basis</a>. The buses will be running on a Sunday/Holiday schedule and they&#x2019;ll be free. Music City Star is still down for the count.</li>\n<li>WSMV takes a look at <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/video/23447392/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">what flooding victims should do if they don&#x2019;t have flood insurance</a>, which describes the situation for most folks in Middle Tennessee.</li>\n<li>Now that the flood waters are receding, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/2010-flood/water-recedes-crews-begin-deal-rattled-roads?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">road crews are having a heckuva time assessing the damage</a>.</li>\n<li>The Army Corps of Engineers are saying that <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=17113\" target=\"_blank\">all the water they released from area dams yesterday prevented a bad situation from getting much worse</a>.</li>\n<li>The Metro Nashville Police Department is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12426922\" target=\"_blank\">getting a real workout this week</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by Jim Leigh.</em></p>"
