Owner (and brewmaster extraordinaire) Linus Hall plans to have the new brewery and taproom open by the beginning of 2010.</p>\n<p>How do you feel about the move? We hold the Marathon Building near and dear to our hearts, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/02/19/make-hoppy-history-yazoo-auctioning-off-first-pint-in-new-brewery/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Make Hoppy History: Yazoo Auctioning Off First Pint In New Brewery\">Make Hoppy History: Yazoo Auctioning Off First Pint In New Brewery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/18/pour-up-yazoo-tweet-up-tonight-at-the-melrose-pub/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Pour Up: Yazoo Tweet-Up Tonight At The Melrose Pub\">Pour Up: Yazoo Tweet-Up Tonight At The Melrose Pub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/02/whats-going-on-with-the-gulch/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: What&#x2019;s Going On With The Gulch?\">What&#x2019;s Going On With The Gulch?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/04/clear-the-roads-cool-springs-chuys-open-for-business-and-heading-for-the-boro/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Clear The Roads, Cool Springs: Chuy&#x2019;s Open For Business (And Heading For The &#x2018;Boro)\">Clear The Roads, Cool Springs: Chuy&#x2019;s Open For Business (And Heading For The &#x2018;Boro)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/17/turnip-truck-urban-fare-opening-in-the-gulch-this-october/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Turnip Truck &#x201C;Urban Fare&#x201D; Opening In The Gulch This October\">Turnip Truck &#x201C;Urban Fare&#x201D; Opening In The Gulch This October</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
