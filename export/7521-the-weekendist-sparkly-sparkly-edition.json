One of these days we will write The Weekendist before it&#x2019;s actually the weekend. Sorry about your Friday night (it&#x2019;s ok, we&#x2019;re sitting at home watching Netflix too), but here are our picks for the rest of the weekend:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.adventuresci.com/default.aspx?section=visit&amp;title=special+event&amp;page=181\" target=\"_blank\">CHOMP!</a></strong> <em>Saturday, July 30 at the Adventure Science Center, 11am-4pm, regular admission price</em>. Who doesn&#x2019;t want to go to an event called CHOMP!? The Adventure Science Center is hosting a day dedicated to food, and we&#x2019;re totally on board with that. Chomp Olympics? Sign us up! Edible zucchini art? Yes please. Special guests from&#xA0;Blue Bell Creameries, Bongo Java and Olive &amp; Sinclair? We&#x2019;re there. Crunchy bugs? Uh, we&#x2019;ll have to get back to you on that.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.musiccitybrewersfest.com/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Brewer&#x2019;s Festival</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, July 30 at Walk of Fame Park, 12-10pm, $35</em>. Hope you&#x2019;re ready for some day drinking, because the evening session for this year&#x2019;s Music City Brewer&#x2019;s Festival is as sold out as sold out can get. Tickets to the earlier session (12-4pm) are still available but will definitely sell out, so grab your tickets tonight! Sample beer from more than 50 breweries while listening to live music and sweating, then call a cab home. Yum.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.wambradio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Band Dances</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, July 30 at Centennial Park, 7-10pm, free</em>. Don&#x2019;t forget about Nashville&#x2019;s Big Band Dances, Nashville&#x2019;s summer dance series held annually in Centennial Park. Each week features a free ballroom dance lesson, live music and dancing fun for all ages.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B0046849FE15BE0?artistid=1413109&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Ke$ha with LMFAO and Spank Rock</a></strong>. <em>Sunday, July 31 at Municipal Auditorium, 7:30pm, $27.50-47.50</em>. There&#x2019;s glitter, and then there&#x2019;s <em>glitter</em>. So yeah. There is going to be a lot of the latter downtown on Sunday night, and we highly recommend that you come roll around in it with us.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.creationent.com/cal/sttn.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Official Star Trek Convention</a></strong>. <em>Friday &#x2013; Sunday, July 29-31 at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel</em>. Allow us to whisper two magic words in your ear: People watching. We found ourselves a new hobby during the Twilight convention in March, and while it&#x2019;s possible that nothing can top sparkly vampires, the promise of an appearance by Captain Kirk himself is enough to lure us out to the Opryland hotel this Sunday. We&#x2019;ll sit back with our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/BravoGelatoNash/status/96988226845278208\" target=\"_blank\">Spocky Road gelato</a> and watch people line up to pay $80 for an autograph and photo with The Shat! It&#x2019;ll be grand!</p>\n<p><em>Photo of glitter at a real live Ke$ha concert by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/morganlevy/5738461263/in/set-72157625897699533\" target=\"_blank\">morganlevy</a>. </em></p>"
