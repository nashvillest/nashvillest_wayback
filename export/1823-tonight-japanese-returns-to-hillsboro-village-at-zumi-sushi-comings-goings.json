After the mysterious departure of Taste of Tokyo last last year, a Japanese joint in the area is more than welcome &#x2013; Though nothing will take ToT&#x2019;s place in our hearts! Plus we&#x2019;re total suckers for good sushi, and we&#x2019;ve heard great things from a few folks who were lucky and 1337 enough to visit before the grand opening shindig.</p><p>Zumi Sushi opens their doors to the public today, and will be open Sunday through Thursday 11am-9pm and Friday &amp; Saturday 11am-10pm.
