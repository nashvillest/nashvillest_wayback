The sales occur quarterly, and they&#x2019;re never really specific with the start times. If you arrive at the site even five minutes late on a sale day, half of the better gift certificates will be sold out. It&#x2019;s frustrating (especially when you wake up early only to be defeated by the Nashvillians who were a little softer on the snooze button).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Our woes are soon to be no more. The week of September 15-21, many of the Nashville Originals restaurant members are participating in the <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleoriginals.com/restaurantweek.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvilleoriginals.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">First Annual Restaurant Week</a>. It&#x2019;s a three course prix fixe for $20.08 per person. Participating restaurants include Bound&#x2019;ry, Flyte, Cabana, Germantown Cafe, Mambu, Ombi, Rumba, Tayst, Tin Angel, Wild Iris, Yellow Porch, Zola and more. Most of the restaurants have issued a limited menu (found on the Restaurant Week site), but some such as Germantown Cafe are giving pretty much free reign over the menu. PM&#x2019;s menu for Restaurant Week even includes a sake flight.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>A week of fine dining at a low price is so much better than the online gift certificate sale. But for the competitive among us, that will still be there too. Thank you, Nashville Originals.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/24/sorta-recession-y-nashville-originals-restaurant-week-is-back/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sorta Recession-y: Nashville Originals Restaurant Week Is Back\">Sorta Recession-y: Nashville Originals Restaurant Week Is Back</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/09/02/save-the-date-for-nashvilles-next-restaurant-week-september-13-19/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Save The Date For Nashville&#x2019;s Next Restaurant Week, September 13-19\">Save The Date For Nashville&#x2019;s Next Restaurant Week, September 13-19</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/05/nashville-originals-great-food-on-the-cheap/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Originals: Great Food On The Cheap\">Nashville Originals: Great Food On The Cheap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/08/wednesday-shop-for-the-holidays-with-nashville-originals/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Wednesday: Shop For The Holidays With Nashville Originals\">Wednesday: Shop For The Holidays With Nashville Originals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/28/its-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year-nashville-originals-discount-gift-certificates/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: It&#x2019;s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year: Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificates\">It&#x2019;s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year: Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificates</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
