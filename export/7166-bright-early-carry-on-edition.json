Plaintiffs argued that members of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro would be &#x201C;compelled by their religion to subdue non-Muslims&#x201D; and therefore posed a threat to the neighborhood. Chancellor Robert Corlew ruled this week that these accusations were unfounded, though he did agree to hear more on the claim that Rutherford County officials violated an open meetings law when they were discussing the approval of the mosque construction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Probably not worth it.</strong> It sounds like Davidson County Criminal Court Clerk David Torrence may be paying dearly for slacking at work over the past 20 years&#x2013;or rather, not showing up to work two days out of five each week. <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/embattled-criminal-court-clerk-consider-paying-restitution?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29\" target=\"_blank\">Torrence went before the Metro Council last night and learned that he may have to give up as much as 40% of his past earnings or take a pay cut moving forward</a>. Councilman Charlie Tygard is also filing a memorializing resolution calling for his removal from office.</li>\n<li><strong>Titans have a lot of free time these days. </strong>We&#x2019;re really happy for the Titans and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110520/SPORTS01/305200061/2275/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">all of their newfound free time for travel, new business ventures and family time and all</a>, but we (and apparently they) would like to see the 2011 football season happen.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Nashville and Memphis are both <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110520/NEWS/305200047/2275/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">falling victim to some hefty homeland security funding cuts</a> &#x2026; A bridge over the Harpeth in Bellevue&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14678728/bellevue-bridge-renamed-in-honor-of-flood-victims\" target=\"_blank\">has been renamed to honor three flood victims</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/05/peaks-of-afternoon-sun-warming-things-up-awakening-cicadas-warm-weekend-with-a-few-hit-or-miss-tshowers/\" target=\"_blank\">We might see a few scattered thunderstorms today</a>, and we&#x2019;ll definitely see a warm-up &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14680187/tenn-unemployment-increases-in-april-to-96\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee&#x2019;s unemployment rate rose to 9.6% in April</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14677478/asian-carp-spotted-in-mid-state-waters\" target=\"_blank\">Those terrifying Asian carp that jump 10 feet in the air and break bones have been spotted in the Cumberland</a> &#x2026; We forgot to tell you yesterday that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110519/SPORTS01/110519016/2275/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Fisher climbed to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro</a>, which was probably still easier than his last job.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jacob_briggs/5736637617/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacob Briggs</a></em>.</p>"
