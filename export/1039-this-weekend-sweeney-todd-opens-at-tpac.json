It was their first&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.tennesseerep.org/lookin.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennesseerep.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">LookIn</a>&#xA0;of the season and was certainly a hit (or maybe that was the free wine), as we arrived to a full room of volunteers, theatre buffs and a handful of curious folk like ourselves. Other area theatre groups should take a hint and implement similar &#x201C;sneak peek&#x201D; programs &#x2013; the LookIn was a very small time investment (and cost us nothing) that got us excited for much more to come.&#xA0;</p><p>We learned a few things about how the set for <em>Sweeney Todd</em> was created, and were treated to a few musical numbers by the cast. The set is&#x2026; cool! It works just like the movie! With a chair&#x2026; and a chute! And a knife! And they&#x2019;re going to pull it off without Tim Burton! It may be taboo in some theatre circles to mention the film adaptation of <em>Sweeney Todd, </em>but we wanted to know just how closely the movie version followed the original play. So we asked. We were told that the movie is a lot darker and has a lot more blood &amp; gore, while the play is more lighthearted and witty (at least as lighthearted as a murder and cannibalism can be). We&#x2019;d be lying if we said we weren&#x2019;t relieved.&#xA0;</p><p><em>Sweeney Todd</em> opens at the Johnson Theater at TPAC tomorrow night and runs through October 18. We heard that several of the shows have almost sold out, so <a href=\"http://www.tpac.org/shows/calendar/calendar_event.asp?eventID=6346\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tpac.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">grab your tickets quickly</a>. We&#x2019;ll be there tomorrow night, and we may toss a review up over the weekend if we&#x2019;re not too lazy.&#xA0;</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/28/sneek-peak-tennessee-reps-moonlight-magnolias/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sneak Peek: Tennessee Reps&#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Moonlight &amp; Magnolias&lt;/i&gt;\">Sneak Peek: Tennessee Reps&#x2019; <i>Moonlight &amp; Magnolias</i></a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/03/saving-local-arts-why-we-need-tennessee-rep-bailouts/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saving Local Arts: Why We Need Tennessee Rep [Bailouts]\">Saving Local Arts: Why We Need Tennessee Rep [Bailouts]</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
