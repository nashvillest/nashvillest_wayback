Though developers promised roller coasters, a water park, the largest hotel complex in the world, a sportsplex, an NBA team and 15,000-20,000 jobs, digging into their past a bit revealed bankruptcy, revoked business licenses, scam accusations and a track record of failed projects of all shapes and sizes. The zoning proposal would&#x2019;ve allowed them to use their 1,500 acres with minimal accountability to the city of Spring Hill, and leaders weren&#x2019;t comfortable with it. The developers are not expected to file another request, so hopefully we can finally put this thing to rest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ride to the &#x2018;Roo.</strong> A couple of Tennesseans are <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110419/NEWS01/304190031/2275/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">organizing a Ride to the &#x2018;Roo 60-mile bike ride from Smyrna to Bonnaroo</a> in an effort to avoid traffic, benefit a good cause and make the festival a little more green. <a href=\"http://ridetotheroo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Check out their website for details and registration</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>HIV on the rise for young Tennesseans. </strong>Metro health officials are struggling to deal with a surge in HIV cases amongst young Tennesseans. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110419/NEWS07/304190025/2275/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Between 2005 to 2009, new HIV infections jumped 39% for Tennesseans ages 15-24</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/27586760/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">The three teens charged with shooting a Pearl Cohn student</a> on school grounds appeared in court yesterday &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14472625/father-ryan-band-to-perform-in-2012-thanksgiving-day-parade\" target=\"_blank\">The Father Ryan High School Marching Band will be marching in the Macy&#x2019;s Thanksgiving Day Parade this year</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14469393/family-protests-after-being-denied-enrollment-at-brentwood-high?redirected=true\" target=\"_blank\">An Alabama family is threatening to sue Williamson County Schools for not letting the kids register even though they live in, well, Alabama</a>.
