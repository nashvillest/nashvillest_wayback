Three of <a href=\"http://www.newbelgium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">New Belgium Brewing&#x2019;s</a> most popular microbrews have arrived &#x2013; Fat Tire Amber Ale, 1554 Black Ale and Mothership Wit Organic Wheat Beer. They will only be available in the 22oz bomber for at least 90-120 days, but we don&#x2019;t mind.</p><p>We just wanted to know what the hold up was, so we poked around a bit and found out that New Belgium&#xC2;&#xA0; built a new packaging facility last year, which finally allowed them the bottling power to cross the border into Tennessee this month.</p><p>Call up your favorite bar or pub to see if they&#x2019;re serving New Belgium beers, and tip us off in the comments if you spot the beers at any stores.</p><p><em>[Thanks to Josh C. for the tip!]</em></p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/shiokuma/356931600/\" target=\"_blank\">shiokuma</a>. </em></p>"}
