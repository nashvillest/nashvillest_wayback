Well, people are still confused, and rightly so. Let&#x2019;s just make this clear: There are two festivals this year. And that&#x2019;s all we&#x2019;re going to say about that. Here are your options, and you can slice &#x2018;em and dice &#x2018;em however you please:&#xA0;</p><p><strong>The Annual <a href=\"http://www.historicgermantown.org/Street_Festival_%26_Beir_Run.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.historicgermantown.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Germantown Street Festival &amp; Bier Run</a><br></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: #0000ee; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/raccoon-logo3.png\"></a><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/raccoon-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1091\" title=\"raccoon-logo3\" src=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/raccoon-logo3-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a></span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">This is the celebration that allows you to wake up early on a Saturday and go for a nice sprint. But it&#x2019;s probably worth the effort, since this is the <em><a href=\"http://www.historicgermantown.org/Bier_Run.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.historicgermantown.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Bier Run</a></em>, and you get free bier (that&#x2019;s beer). After the Bier Run, a typical Oktoberfest &#x2013; Oops, we mean German Street Festival &#x2013; will take place all day with food, more beer, music and kiddie activities. And a tour of homes &#x2013; how German.&#xA0;</span></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilleoktoberfest.com/schedule.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvilleoktoberfest.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Oktoberfest</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilleoktoberfest.com/schedule.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvilleoktoberfest.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-11.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1092\" title=\"picture-11\" src=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-11-300x65.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"65\"></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-11.png\"></a><br><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Featuring all the same things as the Germantown Street Festival (minus the Bier Run) except the tour of homes is a tour of churches. The most important part is that both festivals will have pony rides for your children. And beer. Amazing.&#xA0;</span>&#xA0;</strong></p><p>So the verdict is that we&#x2019;ll probably walk from one to the other since they&#x2019;re mere footsteps apart. They are both this Saturday, they are both from 9am-6pm, they are both free, and they are both in Germantown. Easy to remember, at least.&#xA0;</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/09/oktoberfest-ish-a-tale-of-two-street-fests/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Oktoberfest-ish: A Tale Of Two Street Fests\">Oktoberfest-ish: A Tale Of Two Street Fests</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/10/05/oktoberstreetfesting-a-guide-to-side-by-side-german-festivities-this-weekend/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: OktoberStreetFesting: A Guide To Side-By-Side German Festivities This Weekend\">OktoberStreetFesting: A Guide To Side-By-Side German Festivities This Weekend</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/09/southern-festival-of-books-a-literary-lineup-worth-seeing/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Southern Festival Of Books: A Literary Lineup Worth Seeing\">Southern Festival Of Books: A Literary Lineup Worth Seeing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/21/happy-hour-too-much-information/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Too Much Information\">Happy Hour: Too Much Information</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/21/this-weekend-music-city-brewers-festival/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Music City Brewer&#x2019;s Festival\">This Weekend: Music City Brewer&#x2019;s Festival</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
