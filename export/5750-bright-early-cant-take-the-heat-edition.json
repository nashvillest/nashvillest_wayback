We interrupt this edition Bright &amp; Early to set the record straight on something very important:&#xA0;With hot chicken popping up everywhere from Church&#x2019;s to <a href=\"http://www.zingermansroadhouse.com/2008/02/26/nashville-hot-fried-chicken-tuesdays/\" target=\"_blank\">some random diner in Michigan</a>, it is absolutely vital that we remember that&#xA0;<a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=20350\" target=\"_blank\">hot chicken started here in Nashville</a>. No matter who tries to claim it or how many chains it turns up in over the next few years, this is our story, Nashville, and we&#x2019;re sticking to it. And while we&#x2019;re on the subject, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72xXxV9qIPg\" target=\"_blank\">please take nine minutes of your day watch this short educational video about the origins of hot chicken</a> for the sake of preserving this important piece of Nashville&#x2019;s oral history. And for our children.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yes, this is a slow news day. </strong>Happy stormy Thursday to us! Maybe. <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/09/storms-today-2/\" target=\"_blank\">We&#x2019;re likely to see some nasty pop-up storms this afternoon that could contain damaging winds and hail</a>, but the good news is that we&#x2019;ll cool off a bit tomorrow.</li>\n<li><strong>The luckiest. </strong><a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100916/COLUMNIST0501/9160326/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Folds is planning a special benefit concert for the Nashville Symphony</a>, which we learned the other day is <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/09/14/bright-early-sound-of-music-city-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">having a heckuva time footing the bill repairs to the Schermerhorn Symphony Center</a>. Ben will be playing alongside the symphony at TPAC on November 27th and tickets go on sale next Friday.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100916/BUSINESS01/9160329/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">You might have noticed that big spike in gas prices over the past week or two,</a> but experts say that it won&#x2019;t last &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100916/NEWS08/9160319/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">We&#x2019;ve got a big fake pot problem</a> here in Tennessee &#x2026; Get your write-in ballot space ready, for&#xA0;<a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2010/09/16/basils-back-baby/\" target=\"_blank\">here comes Basil Marceaux</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theworldtoashes/3527973711/\" target=\"_blank\">cdumo</a></em><em>.</em></p>"
