We hope you haven&#x2019;t packed up your jackets yet, because Mother Nature has decided to <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/03/much-colder-today/\">cool things off for us</a>. Today&#x2019;s temperatures in the 40&#x2019;s will drop to the low 30&#x2019;s overnight, so bring in or cover those plants! We&#x2019;ll see temperatures back up in the 60&#x2019;s by Saturday, plus some rain and potential severe weather. Speaking of severe weather, yesterday&#x2019;s &#x201C;slight chance&#x201D; turned into a tornado warning, and the National Weather Service is now <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14312267/weather-service-checking-whether-tornadoes-hit\">checking to see if any tornadoes actually touched down</a>. Tornadoes or no tornadoes, Middle Tennessee was hit with some pretty nasty thunderstorms last night and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14306631/strong-storms-leave-behind-damage-in-mid-state\">many areas surrounding Davidson County saw significant damage</a>.&#xA0;Welcome to Spring in Nashville, folks.</p><ul><li><strong>Remapping</strong>. The proposed Metro redistricting could <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110324/NEWS0202/103240339/2275/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">throw a wrench in a lot of city council races</a>. Many of the council candidates would end up running in different districts than they had intended, and current council members could end up representing completely different neighborhoods.</li><li><strong>Hallelujah, Amen</strong>. We know that you all greatly enjoy spending the day camped out at the DMV, but we&#x2019;re pretty excited about the <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14309521/new-kiosk-could-reduce-wait-time-for-driver-license\" target=\"_blank\">new driver&#x2019;s license kiosks</a> that will make renewing your license a snap. The kiosks may eventually even pop up in your favorite store! The Department of Safety hopes to &#xA0;launch the pilot program with three kiosks by the end of the year.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
