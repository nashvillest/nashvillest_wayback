Unfortunately, times haven&#x2019;t gotten any easier, and the restaurant&#x2019;s doors have closed for good &#x2013; A heavy blow to the neighborhood. RIP Rosario&#x2019;s, and may your margaritas be reincarnated elsewhere.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Update: An Edgehill Village worker cites the following quote received yesterday from property management:&#xA0;</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;We are very sorry to announce that&#xA0;that effective immediately Rosario&#x2019;s will be closed. We are working diligently to find a replacement tenant for this space.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/26/wheres-mr-tim-the-weatherman-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Where&#x2019;s Mr. Tim The Weatherman?
