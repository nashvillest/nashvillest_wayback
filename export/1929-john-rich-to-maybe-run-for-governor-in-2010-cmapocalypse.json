Last night during a CMA-inspired segment on <em>Larry King Live</em>, he <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0906/11/lkl.01.html\" target=\"_blank\">hinted about some aspirations to run for governor of Tennessee</a> (thanks to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/frankstrovel\" target=\"_blank\">Frank S.</a> for the tip!) Although we feel like this is one of the worst ideas we&#x2019;ve ever heard, we&#x2019;re now banking on a John Rich vs. <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10840346/\" target=\"_blank\">Tim McGraw</a> throwdown in 2010. From the segment:</p><blockquote><p>RICH:  But I have a good time, man. I&#x2019;m not one of the guys that lives in a cave and never comes out of the house. I go right out in the middle of the public and have some fun. <strong>And I&#x2019;m thinking about running for governor of Tennessee in 2010</strong> right now, so, you know, be watching.</p></blockquote><p>RELATED:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/01/raisin-mccain-john-rich-approves-this-message/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich introduces &#x201C;Raisin&#x2019; McCain&#x201D; to the world</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/08/happy-hour-raining-on-our-parade/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich gets accosted by some Obama supporters</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/villarichweb2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich constructs a giant eyesore on Love Circle</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2008/10/17/john-rich-2-fights-in-2-days/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich makes a citizen&#x2019;s arrest in Vegas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2008/10/17/john-richs-attack-this-buds-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich smashes some guy in the face with a beer bottle 24 hours later (&#x201C;The little guy hit me!&#x201D;)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/08/nashvilles-hottest-bachelor-off-the-market-john-rich/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich somehow gets married</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/30/happy-hour-oops/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich writes another bad song about the auto industry bailout</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/05/aw-darn-camp-nashville-postponed-until-2010/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich is bummed that no one wants to pay $8,000 for a private show</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/29/bright-early-lovers-quarrel-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich gets sued by a former Nashville Star contestant</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/02/happy-hour-when-the-rich-get-richer/\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich gets kicked out of Cafe Coco for being a rowdy</a></li></ul><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/9313013@N04/1216337665/\" target=\"_blank\">freddthompson</a>.</em></p>"}
