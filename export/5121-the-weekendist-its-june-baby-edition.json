Make up your minds now not to let the thunderstorms and stifling temperatures keep you inside this weekend, because there&#x2019;s a lot going on that you won&#x2019;t want to miss! And, okay, if you don&#x2019;t want to be outside, you can probably still have fun this weekend too. We&#x2019;ll be back on Monday with the highly-anticipated CMApocalypse Bingo (you <em>are</em> anticipating that, aren&#x2019;t you?)&#xA0;and maybe a survival guide or two.</p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Exit Through The Gift Shop</strong>. <em>Belcourt Theatre, various showtimes</em>. We&#x2019;ll just throw it out there and say that this is probably the thing we&#x2019;re most excited about doing this weekend (and if you can&#x2019;t make it tonight, catch it later this weekend or next week). Tonight is opening night for <em>Exit Through The Gift Shop</em>, a documentary about a documentary directed by the world-famous graffiti artist whose face has never been seen (and we&#x2019;re kind of in love with), <a href=\"http://www.banksy.co.uk/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.banksy.co.uk&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Banksy</a>. If you&#x2019;re not familiar with Banksy and you&#x2019;re reading this, mosey on back to that link in the last sentence and we guarantee your day will be much brighter than it was. And it&#x2019;s Friday, so you know we mean business about that.</li></ul><p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.tasteofmusiccity.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tasteofmusiccity.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Taste of Music City</a></strong>. <em>Deaderick Street &amp; Public Square Park, 11am-9pm</em>. Forget everything you know about Taste of Music City, namely, the admission charge. This year, the event has moved off the bridge and onto solid ground downtown, and has morphed into a free street festival. Sure, you still have to pay, but you&#x2019;ll pay to purchase tasting tickets that can be used to sample the fares of different vendors of your choosing. And they still need volunteers for the 7-10pm shift, which will land you some free food &amp; drink tickets.</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B004485CB476CF6?brand=ryman\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketmaster.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Imogen Heap</a></strong>. <em>The Ryman, 8pm, $27.50-32.50</em>. Okay, so we&#x2019;re lazy and just bought our tickets on Wednesday, but we still managed to snag 4th row in the center section of the balcony. We&#x2019;re not quite sure why this show didn&#x2019;t sell out a month ago, but hey, it worked out well for us!</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilledowntown.com/play/first_saturday_art_crawl.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvilledowntown.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">First Saturday Art Crawl</a></strong>. <em>Downtown art galleries, 6-9pm, free</em>. You know the drill by now. But here&#x2019;s a little tip that we&#x2019;re only giving to people that we really, really like (so what if that&#x2019;s all of you?!): Park in the Gulch and take the FREE <a href=\"http://www.nashvillemta.org/setpage.asp?page=musiccitycircuit.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvillemta.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Circuit bus</a>! Parking is going to be crazy with the show at the Ryman, Taste of Music City and the art crawl happening at the same time, there will be lots of Nashvillians in the street, you&#x2019;ll be loading up on the free wine, and&#x2026; just take the bus. You&#x2019;ll be glad you did.</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://wildhorsesaloon.com/index.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;wildhorsesaloon.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Reopening of the WildHorse Saloon</a></strong>. <em>2-3pm, free</em>. This is one of the best things we could recommend you do if, say, you find yourself bored at approximately 1:37pm on Saturday afternoon. There&#x2019;s a equine drill team, line dancing lesson, performance by Gaylord STARS, live music by Brother Trouble and Jeffrey Steele, ribbon cutting, and it will be like a maze trying to dodge the road closures! Fun! In all seriousness, we&#x2019;re tickled pink that the WildHorse has bounced back from its underwater state, and we&#x2019;re happy to watch it re-open just in time for CMA Fest. Oh, and there&#x2019;s a Puddle of Mudd/Saliva concert later on, but that&#x2019;s not free and we&#x2019;re not recommending you attend that.</li></ul><p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dragon Music Sundays &#x2013; The Justin Kalk Orchestra. </strong><em>Fannie Mae Dees Park,&#xA0;3pm, free</em>. A familiar nod to summer in Nashville, spend your Sunday afternoon at Dragon Park climbing tile dragons and enjoying free music.</li><li><strong>Concert in Crockett Park &#x2013; Little Texas</strong>. <em>Brentwood, 7pm, free</em>. Brentwood has an outdoor concert series of their own, and it kicks off this week! So no matter which side of town you&#x2019;re on, settle in for an evening of free &#xA0;outdoor music and <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">mosquitoes</span> fun.</li></ul><p>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwage/4665723712/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"blank\">cwage</a>.</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/06/03/the-weekendist-cicada-be-gone-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Cicada Be Gone Edition\">The Weekendist: Cicada Be Gone Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/27/the-weekendist-bye-bye-august-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Bye Bye August Edition\">The Weekendist: Bye Bye August Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/10/23/the-weekendist-all-circuits-bent-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: All Circuits Bent Edition\">The Weekendist: All Circuits Bent Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/20/the-weekendist-summer-is-here-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Summer Is Here Edition\">The Weekendist: Summer Is Here Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/11/the-weekendist-not-at-the-roo-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Not At The &#x2018;Roo Edition\">The Weekendist: Not At The &#x2018;Roo Edition</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
