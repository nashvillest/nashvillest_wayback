We know winter in Nashville can get a little boring, so we&#x2019;re glad that<a href=\"http://www.musicrow.com/2009/10/mcgraw-to-film-in-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\"> Tim McGraw and Gwenyth Paltrow have decided to spice it up a bit by filming a new movie here</a>. We have no idea what this movie will be about and we can&#x2019;t imagine what sort of convoluted plot could land the two of them on the same screen, but filming is slated for January and February and 80% of it will be happening right here in Nashville. And also, it should be noted that the producers chose us over Austin.</p><ul><li><strong>Nashville&#x2019;s got talent.</strong> A band of Healthways employees out of Franklin <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091008/COUNTY090101/910080321/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">brought home the title of America&#x2019;s #1 Corporate Rock Band</a> after competing in an annual showdown at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame judged by Motley Crue&#x2019;s Tommy Lee.</li><li><strong>Kidnapping case leak. </strong>The TBI is investigating <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11276535\" target=\"_blank\">who might have leaked confidential information about the newborn kidnapping case</a> earlier this week, specifically information on the investigation of the family&#x2019;s alleged attempts to sell the child.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Tennessee&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11279408\" target=\"_blank\">traffic fatalities are down by nearly 100</a> compared to last year &#x2026; Metro is promising to help some of the fairgrounds tenants <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11277367\" target=\"_blank\">find new places to set up shop</a> &#x2026; Dickson County Schools are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11277790\" target=\"_self\">preparing for a complete shutdown</a> if they can&#x2019;t pass a new budget &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/dean-pave-states-first-green-street-praise\" target=\"_blank\">Deadrick Street is finally reopening</a> and it&#x2019;s a little bit greener &#x2026; Metro is now allowing church groups of up to 25 <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/revision-allows-religious-gatherings-metro-parks\" target=\"_blank\">meet in public parks regularly without a permit</a>.</li></ul><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/yummiec00kies/2512429469/\" target=\"_blank\">yummiec00kies</a>.</em></p>"}
