Owner Jennifer Casale opened The Green Wagon&#x2019;s first location less than six months ago, in early January. What&#x2019;s that you say about a recession?</p>\n<p>Our favorite part about The Green Wagon is, hands-down, the bulk filling station where customers can refill bottles of various cleaning products, thereby eliminating the waste of buying a new bottle and saving a few pennies in the process. The new location will also house a vegetarian cafe, and we hope it lasts longer than the last vegetarian cafe in East Nashville.</p>\n<p>East Nashvillians, will you welcome The Green Wagon to the neighborhood? Do you think it can coexist peacefully with the Turnip Truck? Can a vegetarian cafe actually survive over yonder? Fill us in.</p>"
