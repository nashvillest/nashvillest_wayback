Though information has been (purposefully) vague, it doesn&#x2019;t take a genius to check out the Sounds&#x2019; <a href=\"http://nashvillesounds.com/schedule/promotions.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Promotional Schedule</a> and notice the absence of what some would consider an essential Nashville tradition: Thirsty Thursdays.</p>\n<p>We first noticed conflicting reports a few weeks ago, with <em>The Tennessean</em> reporting that the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090316/TUNEIN/90316034/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">season would open with a Thirsty Thursday</a>,<em> The City Paper</em> reporting that the promotion would be <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=66833\" target=\"_blank\">trimmed down to once a month</a>, and <a href=\"http://yazoobrew.blogspot.com/2009/01/yazoo-partnering-up-with-nashville.html\" target=\"_blank\">talk at Yazoo</a> about a partnership with the Sounds for Thirsty Thursdays. It wasn&#x2019;t until yesterday that <em>The City Paper</em> confirmed our worst fears, that <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=67228\" target=\"_blank\">Thirsty Thursdays are indeed no more</a>. Instead, the Sounds&#x2019; promotional schedule is packed full of all-ages fun this year. We&#x2019;ll see Sundae Sundays, Reading Club Days, Autograph Days, Faith Nights and the usual three tons of fireworks, but no particularly enticing deals on booze.</p>\n<p>Of course, there&#x2019;s always a silver lining. We might have to pay full price, but the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/yazoobrewmaster/status/1378283230\" target=\"_blank\">Yazoo will indeed be flowing at Sounds games</a> this year, they haven&#x2019;t done away with Dollar Dog Days (yet, those fun-suckers), and <a href=\"http://nashvillesounds.com/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">tickets are still dirt cheap</a> ($6 for general admission). So hey! If we can manage to brush this chip off our shoulder about Thirsty Thursdays, you&#x2019;ll probably find us at a few games this year anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Nashville Sounds Season Opener against the New Orleans Zephyrs at Greer Stadium<br>\n</strong>Thursday, April 9, 2009 at 7pm<br>\nPurchase tickets <a href=\"http://nashvillesounds.com/schedule/Default.asp?scheduleId=1290\" target=\"_blank\">online</a> or at the box office</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smailtronic/2548199791/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>msmail</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
