Not to state the obvious, but it snowed again last night. Since that&#x2019;s all anyone seems to be talking about on the internet, we&#x2019;re going to spend most of this post talking about it too. You&#x2019;ve been warned! The 2 inches of snow that blanketed Nashville yesterday afternoon and evening have predictably caused a bit of chaos on our roads. Low temperatures persisted throughout and after the snowfall, causing&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/13877173/swift-cold-front-pushing-sleet-snow-into-tennessee\" target=\"_blank\">black ice</a> and <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/01/slick-friday-be-careful-if-you-must-hit-the-roads/\" target=\"_blank\">slick roads</a>. <a href=\"http://ht.ly/3HXTp\" target=\"_blank\">The kids got another snow day</a>.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110121/NEWS01/110121004/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">And the low temperatures are not going away</a>. But not to worry! Kroger&#x2019;s dedicated Storm Teams are working around the clock, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110121/NEWS01/101210336/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">overstocking their shelves with bread, milk, eggs and ground beef</a> so that our snowed-in selves will not perish in the snowpocalypse (if you can get to the nearest Kroger, at least). P.S.: <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/outlook/weather-news/news/articles/south-wintry-threat_2011-01-20\" target=\"_blank\">There might be another storm on the way</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>As long as we can keep our vuvuzelas</strong>. A new bill proposed by Metro Councilman Mike Jameson would <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/26561611/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">ban megaphones and other sound amplifiers from city sidewalks</a>, which could be good news if Westboro Baptist ever decides to come back to town. However, the First Amendment Center has looked at the bill and thinks it&#x2019;s unconstitutional, and the bill is currently under further legal analysis.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; Pieces</strong>.
