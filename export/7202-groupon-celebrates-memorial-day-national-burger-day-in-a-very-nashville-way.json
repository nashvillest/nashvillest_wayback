It&#x2019;s apparently an annual holiday observed in the US on May 28, falling conveniently over Memorial Day weekend (a legitimate burger celebration in and of itself). And we&#x2019;re not the only ones who noticed the coincidence. <a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/r/uu271413\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.groupon.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Groupon</a> is observing both holidays together, starting locally with a half-price deal for one of our favorites, <a href=\"http://gr.pn/jpEJgH\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;gr.pn&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Gabby&#x2019;s Burgers &amp; Fries</a> , and offering similar burger deals all over the country. We also have a side deal for <a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/back-yard-burgers-2?utm_campaign=UserReferral&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=uu271413\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.groupon.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Back Yard Burgers</a>, or if you want to go the make-it-at-home route, yet another side deal for a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/natures-prime-organic-foods-nashville-tn?utm_campaign=UserReferral&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=uu271413\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.groupon.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Nature&#x2019;s Prime Organic Foods burger pack</a>. Get your Gabby&#x2019;s deals fast &#x2013; they&#x2019;re only offering 800 this time, and at 8am over 200 had already been sold (edit: as of 10am, Gabby&#x2019;s Groupons are sold out).</p><p>Alongside the burger deals, <a href=\"http://www.groupon.com/deals/not-alone\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.groupon.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">every Grouponer in the U.S. can make donations in $1, $5 or $25 increments for&#xA0;Nashville&#x2019;s own Not Alone</a> &#x2013; an organization that provides free and confidential counseling and support services for military families affected by combat stress. What&#x2019;s more, <em>all pledges will be matched by an anonymous donor up to $350,000</em>.&#xA0;We can&#x2019;t pass up a great deal or the opportunity to support a local charity, especially when our dollars count double on both accounts.</p><p>Of course, this brings up a debate we have often here at Nashvillest &#x2013; what do YOU think the best burger in town is? Last time we threw out this question, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/29/the-food-network-names-rotiers-cheeseburger-best-in-tennessee/\" target=\"_blank\">Rotier&#x2019;s was the narrow front runner over PM</a>&#x2026; But that was before Gabby&#x2019;s and Burger Up arrived on the scene, so the tables may have turned since then. What do you think?</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/willie_901/4172122548/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">william c hutton jr</a>. </em></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/05/collective-buying-power-website-groupon-comes-to-nashville/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Collective Buying Power Website Groupon Comes To Nashville\">Collective Buying Power Website Groupon Comes To Nashville</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/06/28/beef-up-your-4th-of-july-weekend-with-burger-eating-contest-at-melrose/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Beef Up Your 4th Of July Weekend With Burger Eating Contest At Melrose\">Beef Up Your 4th Of July Weekend With Burger Eating Contest At Melrose</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/28/cool-end-to-national-ice-cream-month-free-bravo-gelato-on-saturday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Cool End To National Ice Cream Month: Free Bravo Gelato On Saturday\">Cool End To National Ice Cream Month: Free Bravo Gelato On Saturday</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
