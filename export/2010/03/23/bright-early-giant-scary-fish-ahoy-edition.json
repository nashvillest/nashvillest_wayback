If you&#x2019;re the kind of person who enjoys having new things to fear in life, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12184728\" target=\"_blank\">let&#x2019;s discuss the Asian Carp invasion here in Middle Tennessee</a>. The Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency is warning boaters that these fish, which were imported into the states for catfish farms in the 1980s, have been spotted in the Cumberland. The problem is that they can jump 8-10 feet in the air when scared, and because they weigh up to 40 lbs, they can seriously injure whomever they run into along the way, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_carps\" target=\"_blank\">leading to &#x201C;cuts from fins, black eyes, broken bones, back injuries, and concussions</a>.&#x201D; Not that we spend a lot of time boating on the Cumberland, but we&#x2019;re pretty sure these critters will visit us in our nightmares.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Riding the internet wave.</strong> Rather than bucking the social networking trend, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12183279\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Schools has decided to hop on board as a way to communicate with parents and keep them current on the school system&#x2019;s happenings</a>. You can now find them on both <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nashville/Metro-Nashville-Public-Schools/341931529889?filter=2\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/metroschools\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Cut off.</strong> Due to some pretty hefty budget cuts, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100323/NEWS0202/3230341/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Nashville General Hospital has stopped providing free care to undocumented immigrants</a> as a part of their indigent services. Even with the change, the number of indigent patients they&#x2019;ve served has still increased significantly from last year. Emergency care is still available to anyone who needs it.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Seriously, y&#x2019;all. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12184132\" target=\"_blank\">Fill out your census forms and mail them in</a>. It helps people get the services they need, even if you don&#x2019;t need them &#x2026; The Nashville Rescue Mission is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12186040\" target=\"_blank\">opening up a brand new Family Life Center</a> &#x2026; A local man says that his cat, which died of cancer caused by asbestos poisoning, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12184520\" target=\"_blank\">might have saved his life</a> &#x2026; The health care reform legislation could have <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=16051\" target=\"_blank\">a big impact on Tennessee&#x2019;s budget</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/greystgirl/2951676933/\" target=\"_blank\">Grey Street Girl</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
