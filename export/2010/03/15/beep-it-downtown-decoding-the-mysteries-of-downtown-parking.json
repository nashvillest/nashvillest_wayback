BEEP stands for <strong>B</strong>est <strong>E</strong>ver <strong>E</strong>vent <strong>P</strong>arking, and while mildly cheesy, we can see this being a lifesaver for the next few months. Beginning tonight for the Muse concert and continuing through May 31, Lot R at LP Field will be open for FREE parking with an optional $3 round-trip shuttle service during every Bridgestone Arena event. Shuttles will run every 10 minutes from Lot R to the corner of 4th &amp; Demonbreun. Parking at LP Field will open 2 hours prior to the scheduled Bridgestone Arena event, and close at 2am.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/grovesa16/4402245553/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>grovesa16</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/22/nashvillest-psa-that-parking-lot-in-back-of-the-pancake-pantry-charges-for-parking-now-sort-of/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashvillest PSA: That Parking Lot In Back Of The Pancake Pantry Charges For Parking Now, Sort Of\">Nashvillest PSA: That Parking Lot In Back Of The Pancake Pantry Charges For Parking Now, Sort Of</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
