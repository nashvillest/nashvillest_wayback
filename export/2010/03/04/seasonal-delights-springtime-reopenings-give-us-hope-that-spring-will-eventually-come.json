Bobbie&#x2019;s Dairy Dip for lunch at 12pm Monday (3/8)! We&#x2019;ll see you there!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/nicholaswyoung/status/9833149227\" target=\"_blank\"><em>nicholaswyoung</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/24/nashville-newcomers-fleur-de-lis-flavors-throws-new-orleans-snowballs-at-us/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Newcomers: Fleur de Lis Flavors Throws New Orleans Snowballs At Us\">Nashville Newcomers: Fleur de Lis Flavors Throws New Orleans Snowballs At Us</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
