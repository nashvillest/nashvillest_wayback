It&#x2019;s not often that we have so much happening in one weekend during the winter months, so much so that we&#x2019;re dubbing this weekend &#x201C;March Madness&#x201D; (at least for us). Get out and enjoy the sun &amp; mid-50&#x2032;s temperatures, and take your pick from the madness.</p>\n<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mercylounge.com/calendar/venue/cannery/2010/03/05/ani-difranco/\" target=\"_blank\">Ani DiFranco with Erin McKeown</a>. </strong><em>9pm,&#xA0;Cannery</em><em> Ballroom, $38.</em> Ani DiFranco needs no introduction from us.

With Peter Barbee, Keegan DeWitt and other special guests. Though Tyler James has been relentlessly playing his music for years, both around Nashville and on the road, he&#x2019;s waited until now to release a debut full-length record. Whether you know Tyler&#x2019;s music from Ten out of Tenn, or you&#x2019;re more familiar with his solo work, we think you&#x2019;ll be pleasantly surprised when you try on&#xA0;<em>It Took The Fire</em> for size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/04/saturday-podcamp-nashville-at-cadillac-ranch/\" target=\"_blank\">PodCamp Nashville</a>. </strong><em>9am-4pm, afterparty 4-7pm, Cadillac Ranch, free</em>.

We&#x2019;re absolutely thrilled that it&#x2019;s ever-so-slightly warmer this week, as it makes gallery-hopping much more fun.

Tickets to the gala and live telecast are $50 for Belcourt members, $75 for non-members, but if you want to hit up the patron&#x2019;s party beforehand, it&#x2019;ll cost you a bit more&#x2026; But we hear it&#x2019;s always worth it.</li>\n<li><strong>They Might Be Giants at Exit/In</strong>.
