For starters, <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/03/fine-weather-ahead/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/nashvillewx.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">the weather is going to be amazing this weekend</a>, so we suggest that you start planning some ways to get out and enjoy it ASAP. However, not everyone is having the Best Winter Ever, as <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12086184\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wkrn.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">you might&#x2019;ve noticed the signs popping up at restaurants around town about a tomato shortage</a>. We&#x2019;ve seen this a few times over the past few years, and this time Florida&#x2019;s unseasonably cold weather is to blame. The price of tomatoes is on the rise and many restaurants are temporarily yanking them from the menu or adding them by request only. Unlike the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/02/bright-early-everything-old-is-new-again-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">devastating Chicken Wing Shortage</a>, the tomato thing should resolve itself in a few weeks when the spring harvest happens. Fret not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Park it.</strong> As downtown parking becomes somewhat of a shrinking commodity, we&#x2019;re hearing all sorts of tales of <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12088143\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">both privately owned and Central Parking lots engaging in some price-gouging</a> (or just taking advantage of supply and demand).
