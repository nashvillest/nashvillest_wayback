City officials are busy trying to find ways to coerce our city to recycle more. <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/one-person-s-trash\" target=\"_blank\">Currently 67% of Nashvillians participate in the curbside recycling program, which isn&#x2019;t too shabby, but the Dean administration wants to find out why the other third isn&#x2019;t recycling</a>.&#xA0; Typically, the rate of participation in a recycling program is greater among folks renting property because they&#x2019;re often younger than homeowners and younger people recycle. In Nashville, however, younger neighborhoods like East Nashville and Sylvan Heights have some of the lowest participation. Green Hills and Belle Meade have actually taken the lead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Violence in schools. </strong><a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100301/NEWS03/3010322/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Gangs are still a big problem in Metro Nashville Public Schools, and even in Williamson County</a>.
