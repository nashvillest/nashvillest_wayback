But it&#x2019;s never too late for green beer, so check out our top picks for the evening. Be safe, and program 862-RIDE into your phones now &#x2013; It&#x2019;s the sheriff&#x2019;s Sober Ride program, and it&#x2019;s good for a free ride home until 2am.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.travisdesigns.com/pubcrawl/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Lucky East Yazoo Brew Pub Crawl</a></strong>. <em>7pm-12am, East Nashville&#x2019;s Five Points, free</em>. Pub crawl around East Nashville&#x2019;s Five Points, beginning the evening with a Yazoo beer chug contest at Red Door and ending with the &#x201C;sexiest dressed&#x201D; contest at 3 Crow Bar, grand prize giveaways and more! We love the Get Lucky East crawl, but good luck getting in the doors. It&#x2019;ll be packed!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=366032406306&amp;index=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Greenman Cometh St. Patty&#x2019;s Day at MAI</a></strong>. <em>10pm-3am, MAI, free</em>.

Okay okay, so it&#x2019;s not a St. Patty&#x2019;s Day event per se, but it&#x2019;s where your Nashvillest editors will be spending the first part of their holiday evening. We highly recommend this show if you&#x2019;re not in the green-beer-and-car-bombs mood.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.danmcguinnesspub.com/nashville/calendar.php/month/3/year/2010/day/17/view/grid#13_1268841600\" target=\"_blank\">St. Patty&#x2019;s Day at Dan McGuinness</a></strong>. <em>All day, both locations, $10 cover</em>. Dan McG&#x2019;s kicked off their celebration early this morning, Kegs &#x2018;n Eggs style.

The music is already going strong, and we have a sneaking suspicion that the Roundabout Vandals are one of the performing acts this evening. Will we get a confession? We&#x2019;ll see!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.mcfaddensnashville.com/events-description.php?id=19603\" target=\"_blank\">McPatty&#x2019;s Fest</a></strong>. <em>McFadden&#x2019;s, $10</em>.
