We&#x2019;re glad she enjoyed her stay here while filming the new movie&#xA0;<em>Love Don&#x2019;t Let Me Down </em>with Tim McGraw, and we have to admit she has great taste.</p>\n<p>She talks about the staples &#x2013; the Ryman, Grand Ole Opry, Station Inn and The Loveless Cafe.</p>\n<p>She ventures outside of the tourist books to enjoy some of our favorites &#x2013; The Family Wash, Prince&#x2019;s Hot Chicken Shack (okay, we&#x2019;re a little skeptical that she actually tried this one, but whatever!), City House, Whiskey Kitchen, Margot and The Patterson House.</p>\n<p>She drank coffee at all of our favorite spots &#x2013; Ugly Mugs, Frothy Monkey, Bongo Java and Fido (even if she did weirdly refer to Fido as the restaurant inside Bongo Java).</p>\n<p>And she even spent some time learning about our local products and the places that sell them &#x2013; Olive &amp; Sinclair Chocolate Co., Drew&#x2019;s Brews and the Turnip Truck.</p>\n<p>And then, <a href=\"http://goop.com/newsletter/75/en/\" target=\"_blank\">GOOP Does Nashville Part Duex</a> hit our inboxes this morning. This lady is hardcore! In addition to heaping glowing praises on Imogene + Willie as &#x201C;one of the coolest stores I have ever been to,&#x201D; Ms. Paltrow covers the other half of Broadway that she didn&#x2019;t manage to fit in the first newsletter (Hatch Show Print, Gruhn Guitars), Green Hills boutiques (Two Elle, H. Audrey), everyone&#x2019;s favorite independent record shop (we&#x2019;ll let you take a wild&#xA0;<a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/tag/grimeys/\" target=\"_blank\">guess</a> on that one), The Carl Von Vechten Gallery at, um, &#x201C;Fist University&#x201D; (we had to),&#xA0;Nashville musicians and an exhausting list of fun places for kids. Whew.</p>\n<p>We have to wonder though&#x2026; Did Gwyneth Paltrow actually <em>work</em> while she was in town? We haven&#x2019;t been to half of these places, and we live here! We kid, we kid. We&#x2019;re especially grateful to Ms. Paltrow for giving some of Nashville&#x2019;s lesser-known gems a chance to shine, and for that, we&#x2019;d welcome her back any day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/18/happy-hour-badly-broken-brackets/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Badly Broken Brackets\">Happy Hour: Badly Broken Brackets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/13/october-fools-east-nashville-not-really-getting-tunnel-to-downtown/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: October Fools: East Nashville Not Really Getting Tunnel To Downtown\">October Fools: East Nashville Not Really Getting Tunnel To Downtown</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/11/new-york-magazine-goes-beyond-country-in-nashville/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: New York Magazine Goes &#x201C;Beyond Country&#x201D; In Nashville\">New York Magazine Goes &#x201C;Beyond Country&#x201D; In Nashville</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
