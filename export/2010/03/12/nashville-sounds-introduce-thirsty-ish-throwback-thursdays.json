The Nashville Sounds will introduce &#x201C;Throwback Thursdays&#x201D; this year, offering hot dogs, pretzels, nachos, sodas and, yes, beer (!) for just $2 each. While it&#x2019;s a 100% markup on the $1 beers we used to guzzle on Thirsty Thursdays, we really can&#x2019;t complain about this.</p>\n<p>Individual tickets for this season <a href=\"http://nashvillesounds.com/news/news.asp?newsId=3234\" target=\"_blank\">go on sale</a> this Tuesday, March 16. The Sounds are also offering new ticket flex packs of undated vouchers, so you can use your tickets whenever and with whomever you please. Like on Throwback Thursdays.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephenyeargin/2700501404/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>stephenyeargin</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/03/not-so-thirsty-thursdays-at-greer-stadium-in-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Not-So-Thirsty-Thursdays At Greer Stadium In 2009\">Not-So-Thirsty-Thursdays At Greer Stadium In 2009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/15/almost-friday-nashville-sounds-thirsty-thursdays/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Almost Friday: Thirsty Thursdays at Greer Stadium\">Almost Friday: Thirsty Thursdays at Greer Stadium</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/16/happy-hour-leave-it-to-beaver/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Leave It To Beaver\">Happy Hour: Leave It To Beaver</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/14/baja-fish-taco-sounds-weird-tastes-delicious-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Baja Fish Taco: Sounds Weird, Tastes Delicious?
