Nutritionists would also like to remind these creatures that they should stick to a 2,000-calorie diet, even if they are excited. Kentucky, we are actually feeling a little offended FOR you.

No drug dealer in his or her mind will ever voluntarily pay this, of course, but it does force them to pay up when they get caught in addition to whatever sentence they receive for the distribution or possession charges they&#x2019;ve already racked up.
