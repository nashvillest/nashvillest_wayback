By the looks of our Twitter feed, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12129311\" target=\"_blank\">many of you guys started out the morning in the dark</a>. According to NES lightning struck the Edmonson Pike substation a little after 6am, causing a widespread power outage that lasted for about an hour and affected more than 10,000 customers. <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/03/big-rains-and-storms/\" target=\"_blank\">Storms are expected to continue throughout the morning, but are mostly on their way out</a>. Hopefully NES can manage to keep the lights on for us, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/22812986/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">especially since they&#x2019;re giving us fancy new meters that double our electric bills</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expensive grills.</strong> The city <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/22816242/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">may soon be shelling out $95,000 to settle a lawsuit involving a gold grill</a> (which reminds us of <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/21/metro-police-auction-set-of-gold-grills-with-topaz-lost-found/\" target=\"_self\">this other one</a>). A man was ordered to remove the grill while he was being booked at the local jail, and when he declared that the teeth were cemented in place, the cop reached into his mouth and yanked them out. And then the man was given some Tylenol in lieu of some much-needed dental care.</li>\n<li><strong>Can you hear us now?</strong> On the heels of the budget cut announcements for Metro Schools, <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=15806\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 custodians turned out to the School Board meeting last night to protest Metro&#x2019;s plan to outsource custodial work to another company</a>. Metro plans to cut 665 jobs, most of which are custodial or maintenance-related.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Music City Center construction, in all its disruptive glory, will at least <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12126683\" target=\"_blank\">create about 3,000 jobs</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2010/03/11/from-a-councilman/\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Councilman Jamie Hollin has his own theory</a> about why Metro3 decided not to broadcast last night&#x2019;s board meeting &#x2026; Consider this your second warning to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12124495\" target=\"_blank\">stay clear of downtown while the 180,000 SEC fans run around like crazy people</a> &#x2026; Both the <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/3adbaef5-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Hillsboro Rd. and Murphy Rd. exit ramps will be closed on I-440E </a>this weekend.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/victorjames615/4425505507/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>victorjames615</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
