We&#x2019;re running behind, this is going to be quick, you know the drill, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even though we mistakenly said that Project Homeless Connect was happening yesterday and no one bothered to correct us, it&#x2019;s actually happening today. And by the looks of the Twitters, it&#x2019;s going rather well! Thanks to all of the fine folks who put it together, along with the army of volunteers, the Key Alliance and Metro Homelessness Commission.

He is essentially our cyber-shoulder to cry on when we&#x2019;ve waited until 11pm on April 17th to do our taxes, so greet him accordingly.

Nothing like the distant memory of trekking down to Tower at midnight in our PJs for album releases to make us feel very old this morning.

This is especially bad news for Fisk, which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for some time now.
