The flooded Tennessee Tower is causing some serious problems for thousands of folks waiting for unemployment checks. A sprinkler system inside the building burst earlier this week, flooding an electrical vault and causing a pretty big power outage. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/26160766/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee Department of Labor officials say that about 40,000 checks are stuck inside the mailing machine and won&#x2019;t go out until Monday</a>. Because the Tennessee Tower houses some other state government offices, too, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101216/NEWS01/101216061/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">state&#xA0;officials&#xA0;are also having a tough time figuring out final revenue projections</a> that usually come out around this time and are used to create next year&#x2019;s spending plan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Happy holidays to us. </strong>Garth Brooks played his first two Bridgestone shows last night, and he only has seven more to go between now and Christmas. <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13683779\" target=\"_blank\">The series of flood benefits is supposed to raise millions of dollars for the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee&#x2019;s flood relief fund</a> and we couldn&#x2019;t be more grateful. Thanks, Papa Garth!</li>\n<li><strong>Movin&#x2019; on up. </strong>We&#x2019;re getting a new police chief soon! As you may recall, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101217/NEWS0202/12170321/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">former Nashville Police Chief Ronal Serpas ditched us for New Orleans shortly after the May flood (okay, so the job had been in the works for a while) and was succeeded by Interim Police Chief Steve Anderson</a>. Now they&#x2019;re hoping to select someone permanent from within the police force and Anderson is in the running.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Those crazy kids at App State have taken to <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/26165387/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">stealing very important leprechaun statues</a> &#x2026; A bank robber struck a Murfreesboro Road Suntrust <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/26164077/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">wearing a cowboy hat</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13685755\" target=\"_blank\">Asurion will be adding 500 new jobs in the Nashville area</a> over the next five years &#x2026; Vanderbilt <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/vanderbilt-continues-work-toward-hiring-football-coach?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">still hasn&#x2019;t found a new coach</a> &#x2026; The TVA was able to <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/20d913e2-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">plug their gypsum leak yesterday</a> in Kingston.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/friendlyghostmedia/3873457903/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Gasparini</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/11/08/bright-early-the-garth-effect-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The Garth Effect Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The Garth Effect Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
