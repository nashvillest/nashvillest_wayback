And furthermore, how big does a beaver have to be before it can be mistaken for a human?

Please, tell us more! Because we can&#x2019;t actually imagine a way in which this story could get better. At any rate, you can <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Giant-Bellevue-Beaver/168294726544602\" target=\"_blank\">become a fan of the Giant Bellevue Beaver on Facebook</a> and help us cement his (awkward) position in a long line of American heroes who will enrich Nashville&#x2019;s history for many years to come.
