As we pointed out yesterday, today is the longest and darkest day of the year, which is sort of depressing! It&#x2019;s also cloudy outside which means <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/12/clouds-should-block-tonights-total-lunar-eclipse/\" target=\"_blank\">our entire city likely missed out on the rare winter solstice lunar eclipse last night</a>, so <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/18046748\" target=\"_blank\">thank goodness for the internet</a>.

But thankfully they were able to shut down the lab, arrest the dude (who was appropriately nicknamed &#x201C;Monkey Man&#x201D;) and turn the monkeys over to his wife.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Winter weather means <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/26198933/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">more potholes for TDOT to fix</a> &#x2026; Not sure about a white Christmas, but <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/12/light-rain-possible-tonight-tuesday-interesting-system-to-watch-for-christmas-eve/\" target=\"_blank\">we may be looking at a slushy one</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/13716171/police-bust-hillbilly-heroin-ring-in-murfreesboro\" target=\"_blank\">Hillbilly heroin bust in Murfreesboro</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/13717877/state-suing-credit-card-companies-over-swipe-fees\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee and 17 other states are suing most major credit card companies</a> over swipe fees &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101221/NEWS04/12210326/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Belmont&#x2019;s President Bob Fisher sat down to answer six pages of questions</a> from the Tennessean &#x2026;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Just Katety</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
