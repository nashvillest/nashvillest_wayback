Whether you&#x2019;re looking for handmade accessories, one of a kind artwork, tasty edibles, hand-me-down vintage or just trying to get your shopping done while supporting a local business, there&#x2019;s an event for you. Shopping during the holidays can be daunting, but skipping big-box superstore lines and browsing with a cup of cider (or a glass of wine) makes all the difference. Here&#x2019;s a list of our picks for local shopping events to make your holiday shopping as pain-free (and maybe even fun) as possible.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nashville-TN/Hillsboro-Village-Events/393145595224\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Hillsboro Village Art Walk</a></strong>. <em>Hillsboro Village,&#xA0;Thursday, December 2, 5-8pm</em>.
