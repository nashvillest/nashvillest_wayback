That beloved and strange full-sized Parthenon replica that sits in the middle of our town has been getting a lot of attention lately.

After the movie opened in February, many families made the trek out to Nashville to see our weird landmark in person. Hopefully they all took the time to look at Centennial Park&#x2019;s other fine offerings, such as the giant clam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Severe weather looming. </strong>Country Music Marathon organizers are <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12359655\" target=\"_blank\">scrambling to make safety plans for runners in case dangerous weather rolls in tomorrow</a>.
