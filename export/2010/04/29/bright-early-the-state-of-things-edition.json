This morning, Mayor Dean will be delivering his annual State of the Metro address at 10am in Riverfront Park. He&#x2019;s expected to deliver all sorts of bad news about the proposed budget for next year, which will be presented to Metro after the address. As we&#x2019;re all amply aware, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/politics/23302805/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">it&#x2019;s been a tough financial year for the city (and the rest of the universe) and we may end up losing some pretty big taxpaper services as a result</a>. There&#x2019;s been some talk of closing eight recycling centers, halting brush pickup, cutting library branches down to 20 hours per week, and closing our beloved super-secret Green Hills county clerk office that&#x2019;s never crowded. You can <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">watch the whole thing live on WSMV.com</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All about the money.</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/23291139/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">bill that would create a constitutional ban on income and payroll taxes might have reached an impasse</a> due to the cost of printing notification of the amendment. Since money is tight this year, a House subcommittee voted to put it off until they know if there&#x2019;s any money left in the budget for it.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay in school.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100429/COLUMNIST0501/4290314/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Paisley paid Belmont students a visit yesterday as part of the &#x201C;Insiders View&#x201D; seminar series</a>.
