Lots of freebies, lots of not-so-freebies, and plenty of fun to cram in. Leave us a comment and let us know what you&#x2019;re planning (and what we missed)!</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Friday</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.belcourt.org/events?id=69784\" target=\"_blank\">Opening Night Dinner and a Movie: Vincere</a></strong>. <em>Belcourt, Dinner @ 6:15pm, movie @ 7, $25.</em> Our heads are still a little bit stuck in film festival mode, and we keep hearing so many great things about this Italian movie that we figured it&#x2019;s worth noting. The opening night shindig includes a fancy-pants dinner and a glass of wine and might also score you some points for date night.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://lwalacommunityalliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lwala: A Night of Celebration</a></strong>.<em> Vanderbilt University&#x2019;s Langford Auditorium, 7pm, $30+</em>. Join the Lwala Community Alliance to celebrate Lwala, an African village best known from the award-winning <a href=\"http://www.sonsoflwala.com/site.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sons of Lwala documentary</a>. In addition to hearing the latest from the village, there will be some cultural performances and a virtual tour through Lwala. Ticket proceeds benefit the Lwala Community Alliance.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mercylounge.com/calendar/venue/mercy/2010/04/30/guilty-pleasures/\" target=\"_blank\">Guilty Pleasures</a></strong>. <em>Mercy Lounge, 9:30pm, $12</em>. If 80s cover bands are your thing, Mike Grimes &amp; co. will be bring the party to the Mercy Lounge. We love these guys because of their 327,893,179-person roster, because they&#x2019;re fun, and because you never know who might show up. Seriously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Saturday</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://cheekwood.org/Calendar/Events.aspx?d=5/1/2010\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cheekwood 50th Birthday Celebration</strong></a>. <em>Cheekwood, all day, FREE</em>. Cheekwood is celebrating their big 5-0 this weekend by throwing themselves a giant party and inviting everyone in the whole world, for free. See the art and gardens and snack on some &#x201C;birthday treats,&#x201D; which we feel is probably cake of some sort.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilledowntown.com/play/first_saturday_art_crawl.php\" target=\"_blank\">First Saturday Art Crawl</a></strong>.&#xA0;<em>Downtown, 6pm, FREE</em>. Good art and free wine always get the Nashvillest stamp of approval, but this is one of our favorites. The gallery crawl spans a few blocks in the heart of downtown and you will not get bored. Check the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.nashvilledowntown.com/play/first_saturday_art_crawl.php\" target=\"_blank\">Downtown Partnership</a> for shuttle schedules, gallery listings and a gallery map. And if you&#x2019;re feeling ambitious,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.nashvillemta.org/setpage.asp?page=musiccitycircuit.html\" target=\"_blank\">consider taking advantage of the free Music City Circulator</a> since parking is pretty much guaranteed to suck.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.brownpapertickets.com/producerevent/93717?prod_id=3430\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Rollergirls v. Arch Rival Rollergirls</a></strong>. <em>Tennessee State Fairgrounds, 7:30pm, $13</em>. Our beloved rollergirls are set to take on the Arch Rival Rollergirls out of St. Louis (<em>Arch</em> Rivals? Get it&#x2026;?) and if you&#x2019;ve never been to a bout before, it&#x2019;s one of the things you need to do before you die. So do it tonight. Also, bring some canned food for the YWCA to score free NRG gear.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bridgestonearena.com/event.php?event_id=220\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy Buffet</a>.</strong> <em>Bridgestone Arena, 8pm, $88.50+</em>. Okay, so if you&#x2019;re committed enough to Jimmy Buffet to shell out $100 for a ticket, then you probably already have your evening planned. But if you want to catch the last-minute train to Margaritaville, there are still some tickets left. Everyone else may want to pay attention to the traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sunday</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B004451D58B7C72?brand=ryman\" target=\"_blank\">Goo Goo Dolls w/ The Rocket Summer</a></strong>. <em>Ryman Auditorium, 7:30pm, $35</em>. We aren&#x2019;t advocating this one, but hey! There might be a few Goo Goo Dolls fans out there still, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/morganplex/status/13018337648\" target=\"_blank\">right</a>? And our inner 13-year olds are still pretty excited about The Rocket Summer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallingwater123/3449224346/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>fallingwater123</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/02/the-weekendist-full-blown-fall-fest-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Full-Blown Fall Fest Edition\">The Weekendist: Full-Blown Fall Fest Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/26/tuesday-rock-and-roll-movie-night-at-mercy-lounge/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tuesday: Rock And Roll Movie Night At Mercy Lounge\">Tuesday: Rock And Roll Movie Night At Mercy Lounge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/09/24/the-weekendist-autumn-is-in-the-house-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Autumn Is In The House Edition\">The Weekendist: Autumn Is In The House Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/14/seven-shows-for-seven-years-happy-birthday-mercy-lounge/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Seven Shows For Seven Years: Happy Birthday, Mercy Lounge\">Seven Shows For Seven Years: Happy Birthday, Mercy Lounge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/02/the-weekendist-4th-of-july-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: 4th Of July Edition\">The Weekendist: 4th Of July Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
