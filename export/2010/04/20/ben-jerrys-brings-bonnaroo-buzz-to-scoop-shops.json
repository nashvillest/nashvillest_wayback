Did somebody say whiskey? The ice cream won&#x2019;t be available in retail stores, but you won&#x2019;t have to haul all the way out to Manchester to get it &#x2013; Bonnaroo Buzz will be in scoop shops soon, and yes, it will also be available at the festival. And mark your calendars, because on May 4 from 5-7pm, scoop shops nationwide will host Bonnaroo Buzz Flavor Release Parties.</p>\n<p>As if having a really-extremely-delicious-sounding ice cream dedicated to them isn&#x2019;t awesome enough, Bonnaroo will be donating their share of the ice cream proceeds to the <a href=\"http://www.bonnaroo.com/about/community-investment.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Bonnaroo Works Fund</a>, which means we have no reason to feel bad about a little indulgence, right?</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/22/free-cone-day-at-ben-jerrys-tomorrow-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Cone Day At Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Tomorrow [Freebies]\">Free Cone Day At Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Tomorrow [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/11/17/bonnaroo-turns-10-2011-fest-to-be-held-june-9-12-black-friday-ticket-presale/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bonnaroo Turns 10: 2011 Fest To Be Held June 9-12, Black Friday Ticket Presale\">Bonnaroo Turns 10: 2011 Fest To Be Held June 9-12, Black Friday Ticket Presale</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/21/best-tuesday-ever-ben-jerrys-free-cone-day-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Best Tuesday Ever: Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Free Cone Day [Freebies]\">Best Tuesday Ever: Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Free Cone Day [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/01/what-exactly-is-kitchen-bling-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: What Exactly Is &#x201C;Kitchen Bling&#x201D; [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">What Exactly Is &#x201C;Kitchen Bling&#x201D; [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/02/you-tell-us-coffee-shops-different-strokes-for-different-folks/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: You Tell Us: Coffee Shops [Different Strokes For Different Folks]\">You Tell Us: Coffee Shops [Different Strokes For Different Folks]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
