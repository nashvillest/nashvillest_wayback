As predicted, <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=14048\" target=\"_blank\">the Music City Center was given the green light by the Metro Council at last night&#x2019;s meeting</a>. The final vote tally was 29 yeas and 9 nays with Eric Crafton, Michael Craddock, Emily Evans and Mike Jameson among the nays. The next hurdle for the project will be the hotel that&#x2019;s supposed to be attached to the convention center for which the city hopes to find private financing. There&#x2019;s also that <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11849271\" target=\"_blank\">small matter of the still-pending lawsuit against MDHA over the shady-ish land acquisitions</a>. Altogether, we can expect the construction to take three years to complete and it&#x2019;ll look like <a href=\"http://www.nashvillemusiccitycenter.com/aboutUs/design.php\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>. The design is supposed to reflect the rolling hills of Tennessee and &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-A8FYNiFk\" target=\"_blank\">could feature an enormous musical instrument that plays on the hour</a>.&#x201D;&#xA0; The other exciting part is that we&#x2019;ll be getting a new roundabout which will maybe mean (if we&#x2019;re lucky) some <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?q=musica&amp;w=715021%40N24&amp;m=pool\" target=\"_blank\">more public art akin to the kind that&#x2019;s in the middle of the other roundabout</a>. We have an exciting journey ahead of us, Nashville.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not it! </strong>Metro&#x2019;s legal department <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11849790\" target=\"_blank\">insists that the city isn&#x2019;t responsible for any damages caused to downtown businesses by the 60+ water main breaks</a> over the past few weeks because it was Mother Nature&#x2019;s fault rather than a faulty infrastructure. Downtown businesses are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=11802386\" target=\"_blank\">pointing out that this is a slightly different tune from the one they were singing a few weeks ago</a>. Some of the city&#x2019;s water pipes date back to the 1800s.</li>\n<li><strong>Trying to save the fairgrounds. </strong>At least one group of Nashvillians is <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/22280610/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">still carrying the torch in the fight against closing the State Fairgrounds</a>. Originally slated to close at the end of June, the mayor pushed back the closure until the end of this year even though there will be no State Fair. A public meeting will be held tonight to discuss some options.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The Tennessee Attorney General put out a <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/nonprofit-leaders-get-helping-hand-new-guidebook?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">new guidebook for any folks who serve on the boards of nonprofits</a> &#x2026; We can&#x2019;t tell you how excited we are for the new <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/01/19/bookstore-preps-avenue-of-the-arts-opening/\" target=\"_blank\">Sherlock&#x2019;s Book Emporium &amp; Curiosities that&#x2019;s supposed to open downtown</a> &#x2026; Second Harvest is busy collecting food for shelters and food banks, and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100120/FEATURES02/1200345/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">also manufacturing it</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11850413\">Charlie Daniels is recovering from a minor stroke</a> he suffered yesterday.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallingwater123/4279736467/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">fallingwater123</a>.</em></p>"
