It seems that everyone has snow on the brain as more predictions about #thesituation2010 continue to surface. At the moment, <a href=\"http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/wwd/winter_wx.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">HPC</a> and the <a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?zoneid=TNZ027&amp;zflg=1\" target=\"_blank\">National Weather Service</a> put us at four inches of snow on Friday during the day with the probability of some more accumulation on Saturday. The <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/01/ice-threat/\" target=\"_blank\">real issue of concern will be the initial layer of ice that could happen before the precipitation changes over to snow</a>, in which case we could see some pretty hazardous driving conditions and power outages. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100128/NEWS01/1280347/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Salt trucks have been out since yesterday doing their thing</a> and coating the pavement (and our cars) with brine. So as much as we kid, please&#x2013;pretty please?&#x2013;be careful out there. And <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11890388\" target=\"_blank\">cross your fingers that the remaining water mains hold up</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Big cuts for MNPS.</strong> Because of our city&#x2019;s budget trouble, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/22358945/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">the money available to train Metro teachers on safety issues like drug abuse, gangs, and bullying will be cut in half next year</a>. Many teachers who deal with those things on a daily basis are concerned that they won&#x2019;t be equipped to handle the situations that come up.</li>\n<li><strong>Health care for smokers.</strong> State Rep. Mike Turner <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/health/22359345/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">withdrew his proposal to deny health insurance for all state workers who use tobacco products</a>, but mostly because it could hurt the tobacco industry in Tennessee.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100128/BUSINESS01/1280354/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Local Toyota dealerships have been flooded with calls and visit</a>s from folks who are concerned about that enormous recall &#x2026; Despite all the hoopla about Metro&#x2019;s LED sign ordinances, they <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/neighborhoods-will-have-wait-little-longer-led-sign-rules?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">won&#x2019;t be making exceptions to the current rules any time soon</a> &#x2026; Congrats to Kevin Mawae for <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/mawae-part-nfl-all-decade-team?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">making the NFL all-decade team</a> &#x2026;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisemattox/4256186498/\" target=\"_blank\">niseag03</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
