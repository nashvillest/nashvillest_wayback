What a short love affair we&#x2019;ve had with you. You&#x2019;ve been so coy, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/30/nashville-newcomers-fresh-blends-juice-smoothie-bar/\" target=\"_blank\">opening one store</a>, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/09/fresh-blends-opens-belmont-location-tries-to-take-over-the-world-comings-goings/\" target=\"_blank\">then another</a>, then <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/18/fresh-blends-exits-east-comings-goings/\" target=\"_blank\">closing the first</a>, but we&#x2019;ve followed you loyally, and we&#x2019;re sad to say goodbye. From <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nashville-TN/Fresh-Blends/58923869447?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=274336300658&amp;ref=mf\" target=\"_blank\">Fresh Blends on Facebook</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 13px; color: #333333; font-weight: normal; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><em>We are sad to announce that Sunday, January 10th, will be our last day of business. We will miss all of our loyal customers and feel privileged to have had the opportunity to serve you. Sincerely, Tony, David, Katherine &amp; Harmony</em></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nashville, help &#x2018;em out. Everything in the store is 50% off while it lasts, so get in there to say your goodbyes and help them clean things up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/18/fresh-blends-exits-east-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends Exits East [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Fresh Blends Exits East [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/09/fresh-blends-opens-belmont-location-tries-to-take-over-the-world-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends Opens Belmont Location, Tries To Take Over The World [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Fresh Blends Opens Belmont Location, Tries To Take Over The World [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/13/more-smoothies-please-fresh-blends-to-open-belmont-location/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Smoothies, Please: Fresh Blends To Open Belmont Location\">More Smoothies, Please: Fresh Blends To Open Belmont Location</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/30/nashville-newcomers-fresh-blends-juice-smoothie-bar/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar\">Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/07/fresh-blends-turns-to-crepes-to-solidify-juicebar-menu/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends Turns To Cr&#xEA;pes To Solidify Juicebar Menu\">Fresh Blends Turns To Cr&#xEA;pes To Solidify Juicebar Menu</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
