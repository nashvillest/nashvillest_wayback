Don&#x2019;t head downtown tomorrow without a pocketful of quarters, because the days of free meters on Saturday have come to an end. As we learned <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/09/happy-hour-going-for-the-gold/\" target=\"_blank\">back in November</a>, January 2010 ushered in a new era wherein we have to start paying for our meters from 8am-6pm on Saturday too. Since y&#x2019;all <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/22/nashvillest-psa-that-parking-lot-in-back-of-the-pancake-pantry-charges-for-parking-now-sort-of/\" target=\"_blank\">don&#x2019;t exactly have the best track record with parking changes</a> (we kid, we kid), we&#x2019;re issuing this Nashvillest PSA to remind everyone to pay up, or expect to find a tidy little ticket when you return.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, maybe we&#x2019;ll actually be able to find a parking spot one of these days. And parking is still free on Sunday!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nahh/2239581489/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nahh</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
