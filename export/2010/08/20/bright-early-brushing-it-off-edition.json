We had sort of a close call with that animal we call the Cumberland yesterday as waters seemed to approach flood stage for the first time since May. With all the rain earlier this week, some water was released from the Old Hickory Dam which caused the river to swell. Though it did serve as an important reminder that the Cumberland has been a jerk to us in the past and can definitely do it again, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=13013350\" target=\"_blank\">it ended up cresting around 34 feet&#x2013;a full six feet below flood stage</a>. Phew! Oh, and thanks to all the volunteers <em>and</em> inmates who spent the afternoon slinging sandbags to make sure we were safe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What a quack. </strong>It was an exciting day for at least one duck boat yesterday when <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24693581/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">the vehicle, carrying several Duck Tour passengers, lost steering on the river</a>. Passengers report that the captain simply drove them around in circles to avoid hitting the embankments until finally a passing barge nudged them ashore. What we would have paid to see that&#x2026;</li>\n<li><strong>Georgia on our mind. </strong>The <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=19916\" target=\"_blank\">ruling on whether or not Fisk University can sell it&#x2019;s Georgia O&#x2019;Keefe original art collection is expected to be decided today</a>, which will hopefully put this entire saga to rest. However, if the judge doesn&#x2019;t rule in Fisk&#x2019;s favor, they insist that they might have to shut the school down due to lack of funding.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24691200/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Evangelist Pat Robertson finally weighed in on the mosque situation in Murfreesboro</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=13017006\" target=\"_blank\">One of the men responsible for the murder of a Vanderbilt professor in 2008</a> received two life sentences &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100820/WILLIAMSON06/8200313/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">If you&#x2019;ve ever dreamed of decorating your whole house like Red Lobster</a>, now&#x2019;s your chance &#x2026; Connected Tennessee <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/08/19/connected-tennessee-gets-23m-stimulus-grant/\" target=\"_blank\">received a $2.3 million grant to expand technology access for kids</a> across the state &#x2026; Tickets are now on sale for the <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/tickets-sale-train-titans-home-games?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Star&#x2019;s service to and from Titans games</a> &#x2026; Vandy continues to add <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/vanderbilt-students-going-green-move-weekend?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">more recycling options for move-in weekend</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ilegion/4590259843/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ilegion</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/24/bright-early-for-the-birds-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: For The Birds Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: For The Birds Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
