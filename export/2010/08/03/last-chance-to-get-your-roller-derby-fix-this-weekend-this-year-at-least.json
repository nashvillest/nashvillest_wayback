Show up Saturday to for the Rollergirls&#x2019; last hometown bouts of the season, a double header against the Ft. Wayne Derby Girls. That&#x2019;s two bouts for the price of one, and it&#x2019;s the last time you&#x2019;ll see them skate in Nashville until April 2011!&#xA0;If you weren&#x2019;t one of the <a href=\"http://chris.quietlife.net/2010/07/12/roller-derby-recap/\" target=\"_blank\">2,384 people present last month</a> to watch the Nashville Rollergirls slaughter Tallahassee in their new Municipal Auditorium home, <a href=\"http://nashvillerollergirls.com/archive.php#tally_more\" target=\"_blank\">you missed out</a>. Big time. But we know you won&#x2019;t make the same mistake twice, right?</p>\n<p>Saturday&#x2019;s first bout will start at 5pm (doors at 4), and the second bout will start at 7:30 at Municipal Auditorium. Tickets are just $10 if you get them in advance from your favorite derby girl or&#xA0;<a href=\"http://nashvillerollergirls.com/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the locations listed on their site</a>, and tickets at the door are $15 (so are <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B004448FD0E67D9?artistid=1408617&amp;majorcatid=10004&amp;minorcatid=205\" target=\"_blank\">Ticketmaster tickets</a>). At either price, it&#x2019;s a steal for four and a half hours of the best entertainment in town.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/16/dont-miss-this-last-chance-to-brave-the-roller-derby/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Last Chance To Brave The Roller Derby\">Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Last Chance To Brave The Roller Derby</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/20/nashville-rollergirls-kick-off-another-derby-season-at-municipal-auditorium-this-saturday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Rollergirls Kick Off Another Derby Season At Municipal Auditorium This Saturday\">Nashville Rollergirls Kick Off Another Derby Season At Municipal Auditorium This Saturday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/15/saturday-see-the-soon-to-be-homeless-rollergirls-close-the-2009-season/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saturday: See The Soon-To-Be-Homeless Rollergirls Close The 2009 Season\">Saturday: See The Soon-To-Be-Homeless Rollergirls Close The 2009 Season</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/09/saturday-nashville-rollergirls-back-at-home-to-take-on-new-orleans/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans\">Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/14/nashville-rollergirls-at-home-again-nashvillest-psa-it-will-sell-out-dummies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Rollergirls Last Home Bout [Nashvillest PSA]: It Will Sell Out, Dummies\">Nashville Rollergirls Last Home Bout [Nashvillest PSA]: It Will Sell Out, Dummies</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
