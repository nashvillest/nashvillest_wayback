It&#x2019;s feeling a little toasty outside, isn&#x2019;t it? Well, more like someone cranked the oven to &#x201C;broil.&#x201D; Yes, it&#x2019;s summer, and yes, it always gets hot, but <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/08/excessive-heat-warning/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillewx.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">temperatures are supposed to reach a record high today with the heat index spiking to 110</a>, which is definitely hot enough to be dangerous. <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12921589\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Metro schools have already canceled all of their outdoor sports practices for the afternoon</a> and officials are advising everyone else to stay in the A/C too, if possible. As we mentioned yesterday, NES says that they&#x2019;re perfectly capable of handling the increased energy demand, but they are asking us to watch our usage between the peak hours between 4pm-6pm to be on the safe side.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flood assistance deadline tomorrow. </strong><a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/one-day-left-register-flood-disaster-assistance?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The deadline for applying for flood assistance is tomorrow</a>. And though we&#x2019;re sure we sound like a broken record, this is really important. Most of you who are plugged into the internet probably know all this by heart, but be sure to spread the word to any friends and coworkers who might not be as on top of things.</li>\n<li><strong>A greener Christmas. </strong>That <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/eco-friendly-christmas-tree-bill-passes-council?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas tree bill that aims to have a live evergreen planted in the Public Square year-round passed the Metro Council last night</a>, so they&#x2019;re putting in a formal request with Metro Parks &amp; Recreation.
