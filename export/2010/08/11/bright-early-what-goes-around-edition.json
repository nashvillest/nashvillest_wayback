Some of you might remember that time last year when East Nashville&#x2019;s District 5 voted to unseat their Metro Councilwoman Pam Murray. <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/13/bright-early-every-vote-counts-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">The recall election came after a nasty months-long fight with her constituents&#x2013;many of whom claimed that she actually lived and worked in Detroit, was mostly unreachable and therefore wasn&#x2019;t fit to represent them</a>. Turns out, she was indeed working at a methadone clinic in the D, but insisted she spent most of her time here in Nashville. The leader of the resistance, Jamie Hollin, was voted to replace her and things have been relatively quiet ever since. Until now! <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100811/NEWS02/8110358/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Ms. Murray has decided to file a defamation suit against Councilman Hollin and 11 other folks who supported him</a>. She&#x2019;s suing each one of them for $1 million in compensatory and punitive damages. But considering she didn&#x2019;t even spell Hollin&#x2019;s name correctly in the lawsuit, she may need to step up her game a bit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trouble on the home front. </strong>Fisk University could be <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=19712\" target=\"_blank\">forced shut down completely if they can&#x2019;t sell half of their Georgia O&#x2019;Keefe art collection</a>. They&#x2019;ve been in tough financial shape for years, and they&#x2019;ve been locked in a court battle over the artwork since O&#x2019;Keefe expressly said she did not want it to be sold, ever, when she gifted it to the university.</li>\n<li><strong>Notorious. </strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2010/8/10/ponzi_figure_stokes_dies_in_prison\" target=\"_blank\">Barry Stokes, Middle Tennessee&#x2019;s famous (or is it infamous?) Ponzi schemer, died in federal prison yesterday</a>. Stokes was serving time for scamming thousands of folks out of about $19 million in retirement savings, and he was recently diagnosed with lymphoma.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Metro Schools have launched a new initiative to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12956916\" target=\"_blank\">attract and retain good teachers</a> &#x2026; A tanker truck created quite a mess in Lebanon yesterday when it <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24587067/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">spilled 1,500 of diesel fuel</a> after running into a gate &#x2026; US Census officials believe that <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/high-unemployment-helps-census-save-money-count?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">high unemployment led to better census workers being available</a> and therefore saved the country a lot of money &#x2026; GM continues to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100811/BUSINESS01/8110350/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">give us some hope about reopening the Spring Hill plant</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunndog818/4002152997/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>sunndog818</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
