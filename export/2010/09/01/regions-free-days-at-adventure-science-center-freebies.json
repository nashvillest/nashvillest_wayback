 "excerpt": "After attending the last Way Late Play Date, we’re pretty much in love with the Adventure Science Center. What’s not to like about zapping germs with a laser gun, playing basketball in wheelchairs and climbing up a giant jungle gym?

What&#x2019;s not to like about zapping germs with a laser gun, playing basketball in wheelchairs and climbing up a giant jungle gym? That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re (perhaps excessively) excited about September 12, when Regions Free Days returns with a little science experiment &#x2013; What happens when you mix &#x201C;free admission&#x201D; with &#x201C;Adventure Science Center&#x201D;?</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re pretty sure the answer will include the words &#x201C;packed house,&#x201D; but that won&#x2019;t stop us from taking advantage of free admission at the Adventure Science Center on Sunday, September 12 from 12:30-5:30pm. This isn&#x2019;t one of those wimpy freebies either &#x2013; Regular admission is $12 for adults and $9 for the kids, and free admission is a rare treat at the science center. Thanks, Regions!</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re over 21 and paying for a child-free science experience (plus a little booze) is more your style, tickets for the next Way Late Play Date on October 26 are <a href=\"http://adventuresci.org/default.aspx?section=programs&amp;title=way%20late%20play%20date&amp;page=247\" target=\"_blank\">on sale now</a>. The past two Play Dates have sold out in advance, so secure your spot now, then start planning your moonwalk-friendly Halloween costume.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/68243098@N00/79029059/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>clarks aunt</em></a><em>. </em></p>"
