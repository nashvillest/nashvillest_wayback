We hope that at least a few of you are out <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13243537\" target=\"_blank\">enjoying the giant party downtown this morning for Employee Appreciation Day</a>. Mayor Dean kicked it off at 8am with free breakfast from Puckett&#x2019;s, and Nashville&#x2019;s Largest Coffee Break happens at 9:30am. There&#x2019;s also a Preds ice cream social later and some sort of public painting thing going on in the afternoon, and all of these events together make us feel incredibly bummed that we don&#x2019;t work downtown. However, all of our sources tell us that this will be a yearly occurrence, so maybe next year. Check out the Downtown Partnership for a <a href=\"http://www.nashvilledowntown.com/work/downtown-employee-appreciation-day/schedule-of-events\" target=\"_blank\">full schedule of events</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Schermerhorn open for NYE. </strong>Though we read earlier this week that the Schermerhorn might be opening in January, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/nashville-symphony-announces-early-return-schermerhorn?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_self\">it turns out they&#x2019;ll actually have things back up and running in time a the New Year&#x2019;s Eve concert</a>. We can&#x2019;t wait to welcome them back!</li>\n<li><strong>Time is up for stimulus jobs. </strong>Today is the <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=20729\" target=\"_blank\">last day of work for about 1,000 folks who were hired into jobs funding by stimulus money</a>. All around rural Tennessee&#x2013;and especially Perry County&#x2013;the jobs were created to combat rising unemployment rates. Now that the money has run out, so have the jobs.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> One of our Broadway honkytonk staples is <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100930/BUSINESS01/9300339/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_self\">expanding to Austin, Texas</a> &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13241800\" target=\"_blank\">International Black Film Festival kicked off in Nashville</a> last night &#x2026; Rep.
