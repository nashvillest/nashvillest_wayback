In case we&#x2019;d forgotten about the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, which took one of the hardest hits during the flood, they&#x2019;re now turning to their endowment for the necessary funding to repair the beautiful building. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12486114\" target=\"_blank\">At the height of the flood, they had about 20 feet of water in their basement</a> which ruined countless instruments, operations equipment and the center&#x2019;s catering facilities. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=13149356\" target=\"_blank\">They expect to reopen early next year, but with federal assistance being pretty slow to arrive, much of the $39 million in repair costs will be fronted by funds from their endowment</a> and slowly replenished as donations and federal assistance roll in. Even so, they&#x2019;ll probably be taking quite a hit. So for the love of all things holy, <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesymphony.org/main.taf?p=1,30\" target=\"_blank\">get out there and catch a Nashville Symphony performance if you can swing it and let&#x2019;s help them get back on their feet</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting a little extreme. </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=13146627\" target=\"_blank\">Extreme Home Makeover crew and volunteers are still hard at work rebuilding Lighthouse Preschool, whose trailer we saw floating down I-24 during the flood</a>. They&#x2019;re still in need of some help if you&#x2019;ve got extra time and expertise, so head over to the <a href=\"http://thenashvillebuild.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Build</a> site to see what&#x2019;s going on and how you can help.</li>\n<li><strong>Gubernatorial debate tonight.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=13148917\" target=\"_self\">Tennessee gubernatorial candidates Mike McWherter and Bill Haslam will have their first debate tonight out in Cookeville</a>. With early voting just around the corner on October 13th, we&#x2019;ve only got a few weeks to make up our minds and there are no debates scheduled for Nashville. You can catch tonight&#x2019;s event live on News Channel 5 or <a href=\"http://newschannel5.com\" target=\"_blank\">streaming online</a> at 7pm.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Sevier Park <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/sevier-park-may-get-community-swimming-pool?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">could be getting a brand new swimming pool</a> along with their shiny new community center &#x2026; The Community Foundation has distributed more than $3 million in flood relief grants to date, and <a href=\"http://www.cfmt.org/floodrelief/grantees/\" target=\"_blank\">you can find the updated list of recipients here</a> &#x2026; Our neighbors in the &#x2018;Noog can now <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100914/BUSINESS01/9140322/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_self\">brag that they have the fastest internet in the entire country</a>.
