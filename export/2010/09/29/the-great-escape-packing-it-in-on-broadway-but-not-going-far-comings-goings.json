Just about every weekend, you could find us at one of two places &#x2013; Eating budget tacos at SATCO or pawing through heaps of used CDs at <a href=\"http://www.thegreatescapeonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Great Escape</a> (sometimes both).&#xA0;And that&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re pretty bummed to hear that the Great Escape&#x2019;s 33-year-old flagship store on Broadway will be closing down on Sunday, October 17 and consolidating with their newer Charlotte Ave location.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not all sad news for Great Escape enthusiasts, though. While not within walking distance for carless, penniless freshmen, The Great Escape on Charlotte Ave will become something of a &#x201C;Super Store&#x201D; and carry twice the inventory, plus a super-discounted outlet store open 7 days a week. The Charlotte Ave Great Escape just recently reopened after spending three months cleaning up from the May flooding, and it should make a cozy new home for all of our dusty Great Escape memories.</p>\n<p>Read the full email sent to The Great Escape newsletter subscribers <a href=\"http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?llr=ezucxkcab&amp;v=001M1I81bNGpIDt-PivV6nsvXkOqAKcKJt8hkR5mm6CMsNx-zphVpgTHEkXJUtf_pcgBMVIlY2lcNEhPGHwWKdkVq5MWXOujvWiYdw3_ne70a79-llE9T0fVA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. RIP, Great Escape Broadway &#x2013; Downtown Nashville and future generations of broke college kids will miss you indeed.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbcurio/2783173066/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>jcurio</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/10/20/chihuly-at-cheekwood-gets-encore-free-day-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Chihuly At Cheekwood Gets Encore, Free Day [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Chihuly At Cheekwood Gets Encore, Free Day [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/08/fresh-blends-blending-no-more-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends: Blending No More [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Fresh Blends: Blending No More [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/26/wheres-mr-tim-the-weatherman-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Where&#x2019;s Mr. Tim The Weatherman?
