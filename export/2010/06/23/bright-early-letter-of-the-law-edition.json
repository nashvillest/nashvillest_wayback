The <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12692247\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee Supreme Court plans to roll out a new program called Justice For All Tennessee, which aims to make affordable legal resources and representation available to a wider demographic of people</a>. Currently, there are a few organizations and resources in place that serve folks who couldn&#x2019;t otherwise afford legal help, but sometimes people who need help like that don&#x2019;t qualify. The new program will include a statewide pro bono summit, involve both lawyers and law students, provide educational opportunities for many different groups of people, and make use of a new justice-oriented website as a clearinghouse for legal resources. They&#x2019;re also looking into creating a new referral system for pro bono legal services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Breaking: Coal mining is expensive. </strong>A new report revealed that <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12692980\" target=\"_blank\">coal mining, including mountain top removal practices, actually costs Tennessee taxpayers about a half-million dollars every year</a> because it uses more money for state subsidies and mine regulations than it contributes through tax revenue and fees. The same study also pointed out that no county in Tennessee relies on the industry for more than 2% of its employment.</li>\n<li><strong>Slip &#x2018;n&#x2019; slide.</strong> It&#x2019;s so hot outside that parents are <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12691984\" target=\"_blank\">being warned not to let their kids near some playground equipment, which could reach temperatures in excess of 150 degrees in the scorching sun</a>. That&#x2019;s more than enough to deliver a pretty painful burn.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>. You never know who might turn up at a Nashville concert, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100622/PROMO/100623005/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">such as Sandra Bullock during last night&#x2019;s Nashville Rising benefit</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12693342\" target=\"_blank\">How does someone get arrested 207 times</a>, we wonder? &#x2026; Today is another one of those days <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/another-air-quality-alert-issued-nashville-area?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">during which you should not breathe</a> and maybe also consider carpooling&#xA0;&#x2026; Along with the latest round of buyout letters, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12690285\" target=\"_blank\">Metro has released a flood buyout map</a> &#x2026; FEMA administrator Craig Fugate, who certainly has his hands full these days, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12691978\" target=\"_blank\">can&#x2019;t seem to keep himself away from Nashville</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/victorjames615/4726168345/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Vic James Photography</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
