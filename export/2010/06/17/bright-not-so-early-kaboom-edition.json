We hope you&#x2019;re ready for <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/06/summer-storms-again/\" target=\"_blank\">another soggy, thundery day</a>. While we&#x2019;re talking about storms, let&#x2019;s not forget the hundreds of folks who are still rebuilding from the flood. Over 6 weeks later, dozens of families in Antioch are still <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/23924722/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">without electricity and running water</a>, the Animal Hospital of West Nashville is still <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12661664\" target=\"_blank\">trying to secure the funds to rebuild</a> and many individuals are still waiting for the Senate to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12662196\" target=\"_blank\">pass a flood insurance program</a> before they can begin rebuilding their homes. Also, don&#x2019;t expect to be able to cool off some <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12661895\" target=\"_blank\">Metro pools</a> quite yet!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can lightning strike twice?</strong> Nashville artist Brad Coriell has offered his services to Solid Rock Church in Monroe, Ohio. You know, the (former) home of &#xA0;the &#x201C;Touchdown Jesus&#x201D; statue that got <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Broadcast/wireStory?id=10915700\" target=\"_blank\">struck by lightning</a> last week? Mr. Coriell would like to help the church reconstruct the big ol&#x2019; Jesus in whatever way he can.</li>\n<li><strong>Ride, Sally, ride</strong>. Two Nashvillians are riding their bikes across the country to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12661979\" target=\"_blank\">raise money for Graceworks Ministries</a>, a Franklin organization distributing food, clothing, furniture and other items to flood victims. You can follow their journey and donate at <a href=\"http://www.bikingfornashville.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BikingForNashville.com</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Did someone say guns in parks?</strong> We heard you guys had a really exciting evening at Movies in the Park last night, while we were sweating it out to some Ke$ha (what? It was a benefit!). Though we&#x2019;re waiting for some sort of official word, responsible citizen @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/heimkev/status/16357358594\" target=\"_blank\">heimkev</a> kept us in the loop via Twitter as he spoke to police and learned what was going on. Y&#x2019;all be careful the next time you head out to watch a chick flick in the park!&#xA0;Update: Kevin Heim summarized the report he received from police <a href=\"http://astoryofnashville.wordpress.com/2010/06/17/fireworks-cause-scene-at-movies-in-the-park/\" target=\"_blank\">on his blog</a>. Looks like it was just fireworks after all!</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>. Chris Johnson finally speaks: <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100617/SPORTS01/6170336/Titans++Chris+Johnson++can+t+play+for++550+000+\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t play for $550,000.&#x201D;</a> Well, we&#x2019;re right back where we started on that one &#x2026; A &#x201C;mysterious package&#x201D; found in Clarksville brought out the bomb squad, but it was just a <a href=\"http://www.theleafchronicle.com/article/20100617/NEWS01/100617005/Messy+box+of+ribs+left+in+Clarksville+parking+lot+creates+bomb+scare\" target=\"_blank\">box of ribs too messy to leave inside</a> &#x2026; Cummins, Inc. will bring <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12664553\" target=\"_blank\">200 new jobs to Nashville</a> (and we need &#x2018;em).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ddfic/722634166/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>DDFic</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
