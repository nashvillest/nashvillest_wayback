With some of the rebuilding costs reaching upwards of $50,000, these folks still managed to fall short of the stipulations for the program, which allows Metro to buy and bulldoze what&#x2019;s left of people&#x2019;s destroyed homes who live in the floodplain. There&#x2019;s a chance that they could receive enough federal funding to expand the program, but they&#x2019;re encouraging people who haven&#x2019;t already qualified to start rebuilding.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Computer glitch.</strong> Folks receiving Tennessee&#x2019;s unemployment benefits had a bit of a scare when <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100608/COLUMNIST0128/6080338/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">20,000 letters accidentally went out informing people that their benefits would be discontinued</a>.

However, Mayor Dean says he&#x2019;s not concerned and isn&#x2019;t really in a hurry to fill the slots with more permanent directors.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Thanks to the flood <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=18398\" target=\"_blank\">the Metro Action Commission has its hands more full than usual with its summer lunch program</a> &#x2026; Someone <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12610023\" target=\"_blank\">keeps dumping important trash</a> behind a West Nashville church &#x2026; The Ronald McDonald House <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12609419\" target=\"_blank\">needs some serious help with flood recovery</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/titans-offensive-line-lacks-familiar-component-fall?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-Sports+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Sports)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">We&#x2019;ll sure miss ya, Kevin Mawae</a> &#x2026; Centennial Hospital has <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/23824932/detail.html\" target=\"_self\">seen a big increase in spider bites</a> since everyone started gutting houses and such &#x2026; Thank goodness <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2010/06/08/wacky-waving-inflatable-arm-flailing-tube-man/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>someone </em>is policing those giant inflatable people</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanwoodchuck/4680065868/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>urbanwoodchuck</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
