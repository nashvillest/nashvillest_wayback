Layoffs are effective June 12th, and the projected reopening date for the hotel is sometime in November.

If it&#x2019;s found that the Army Corps of Engineers is at fault for not giving enough of a heads-up to the National Weather Service or anyone along the Cumberland River regarding dam releases, Gaylord could have a case.

For free. Because 13 is her lucky number, and it&#x2019;ll be June 13th, and somehow she loves her fans enough to spend 13 hours with them and play them an acoustic show. For free! We are so impressed.
