We&#x2019;re definitely in the thick of budget season at both the state and local levels, which has been complicated all the more by last month&#x2019;s pesky flood. Yesterday, the Metro Council deferred a bill that would&#x2019;ve <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/plan-set-minimum-wage-metro-workers-delayed?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)\" target=\"_blank\">increased Metro&#x2019;s minimum wage for full-time workers to $10.77 and given all employees a 2% raise</a>. They&#x2019;ll instead vote on it the same night as they vote on Mayor Dean&#x2019;s $1.52 billion budget proposal. The council <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12578771\" target=\"_blank\">passed the budget proposal for Metro Schools despite expressing downright disapproval of the controversial outsourcing of custodial work</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2010/06/02/the-budget-is-fish-free-sorta/\" target=\"_blank\">General Assembly is well on its way to passing the state budget having finally worked out the whole to-build-a-fish-hatchery-or-not-to-build-a-fish-hatchery issue</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Looking inside Opryland.</strong> Thanks to News 2, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12577760\" target=\"_blank\">we get a bleak look inside the Gaylord Opryland Hotel, and the verdict is that it looks gutted, is still covered in mud and smells bad</a>. But! Crews think they can salvage a lot of the greenery that&#x2019;s inside. So that&#x2019;s good news, right?</li>\n<li><strong>Rocky roads.</strong> TDOT says <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12576842\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;there is still a long way to go&#x201D; with regard to road repairs for flood damages</a>. Most of the remaining problem areas are out in rural counties, and some could take until the end of the year to fix.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong><a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12577804\" target=\"_blank\">Metro&#x2019;s outdoor pools will be opening</a> next week &#x2026; Along with the Opryland Hotel losing business during the downtown, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12577045\" target=\"_blank\">surrounding businesses are also suffering</a> &#x2026; the Metro Council pushed back a bill that would <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/city-bill-eliminate-development-floodplain-curbed?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">ban all development in Nashville&#x2019;s 100-year floodplain</a> &#x2026; For the next phase of TVA ash spill cleanup, <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=18164\" target=\"_blank\">all the ash will be stored right there in Kingston</a> &#x2026; Cuts in the state healthcare program <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12578333\" target=\"_blank\">could eliminate benefits for kidney patients</a>, resulting in a loss of lives &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/24df3c74-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Gatlinburg&#x2019;s famous synchronized fireflies</a> will be visible for a week starting this Saturday.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/marks_pics/4658877640/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mark in Nashville</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/09/bright-early-the-plan-is-to-have-a-plan-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The Plan Is To Have A Plan Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The Plan Is To Have A Plan Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
