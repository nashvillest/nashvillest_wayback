Since the flooding happened almost six weeks ago, F<a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/federal-assistance-floods-tops-200m-tennessee\" target=\"_blank\">EMA has shelled out &#xA0;more than $200 million in federal disaster assistance including $117.8 for housing assistance alone</a>. Additionally, the US Small Business Administration has given more than $64 million in low-interest loans for flood victims and businesses that were hurt by the disaster. Officials say that 62,000 people have registered for some sort of assistance, 15,000 have utilized the recovery centers, and 8,000 have received counseling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No guns in parks for Williamson Co.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12650126\" target=\"_blank\">Williamson County passed a new law banning guns from public parks permanently</a>, no matter what the State of Tennessee has to say about it. Under the new law, folks with permits aren&#x2019;t even allowed to set foot in one of the county&#x2019;s 28 parks or rec facilities with a gun.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep dreaming. </strong>When it comes to the question of whether or not he&#x2019;ll will return to the Titans this season, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100615/SPORTS01/6150343/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Johnson (aptly nicknamed &#x201C;Every Coach&#x2019;s Dream&#x201D;)&#xA0;doesn&#x2019;t have much to say</a>. Basically, he&#x2019;s not showing up to practice until someone gives him a raise. His salary for this year is currently set at $550,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Sumner County is <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12650425\" target=\"_blank\">having a heck of a lot of trouble keeping their food banks stocked</a> since the flood &#x2026; Metro pools should <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/23898726/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">open back up on June 21st</a> &#x2026; Locally-owned BP stations say that they&#x2019;re <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12647700\" target=\"_blank\">definitely feeling the weight of the BP boycotts</a> &#x2026; If you think TDOT is slow now, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12647802\" target=\"_blank\">just wait until the national paint shortage reaches us</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/06/more-heat-more-afternoon-storms/\" target=\"_blank\">We bet you can guess what the forecast is today</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dougclutter/288831235/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>weownthisdoug</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/10/bright-early-the-waiting-game/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The Waiting Game Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The Waiting Game Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/03/bright-early-the-best-policy-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The Best Policy Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The Best Policy Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/04/bright-early-practice-makes-perfect-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Practice Makes Perfect Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Practice Makes Perfect Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
