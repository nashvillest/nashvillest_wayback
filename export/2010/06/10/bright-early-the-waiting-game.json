Today seems to be pretty light on the news-that&#x2019;s-not-about-CMA-Fest front (<a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/fema-disaster-funds-now-available-renters?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">except for this important update from FEMA about assistance for renters</a>), so we&#x2019;re going to give you what we&#x2019;ve got, in bullet form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Nashville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau says we should &#x201C;probably appreciate our visitors a little more this year because we need them a little more this year.&#x201D; Or maybe we should work on appreciating them a little more&#xA0;<em>every</em> year since our tourism is a huge part of our city. This doesn&#x2019;t mean we can&#x2019;t have a little fun with them along the way, though, right? [<a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12623542\" target=\"_blank\">WKRN</a>]</li>\n<li>And while we&#x2019;re in the business of appreciating things, all the free stuff kicks off today. Hopefully we&#x2019;ll have some time here at Nashvillest to bring you the highlights, but in case we don&#x2019;t, you can check out the schedule for yourselves.

[<a href=\"http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashvillecream/archives/2010/06/09/conan-at-third-man-records-tomorrow-night\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Cream</a>]</li>\n<li>There is a 50% chance that we and our 200,000 guests will get stormed on again today. Good news is that it probably won&#x2019;t be as widespread as yesterday.
