For those crying &#x201C;conspiracy!&#x201D; at the museum&#x2019;s seemingly convenient closing, we expect to see your shining faces this weekend at the rescheduled Ford Community Day!</p>\n<p>From 9am-5pm on Saturday, enjoy free admission to the Country Music Hall of Fame (a ticket would normally set you back $20). We took our first trip to the Hall of Fame last year during Ford Community Day, and it was an enjoyable opportunity to see Nashville through the eyes of the rest of the world for a day.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/2885659833/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>cliff1066</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/22/ford-community-day-free-country-music-hall-of-fame-admission-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Ford Community Day = Free Country Music Hall Of Fame Admission [Freebies]\">Ford Community Day = Free Country Music Hall Of Fame Admission [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/01/15/the-weekendist-free-free-free-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Free!
