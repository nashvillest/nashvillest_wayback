Like many other things, we can probably chalk it up to recession-era job loss and a lack of affordable housing. Between 2008 and 2009, the Mission&#x2019;s nightly average rose 15 percent and the total number of meals provided over the course of the year increased 14 percent. Metro reports that <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/22604126/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">approximately 1,700 of Nashville&#x2019;s homeless are children</a>. For information on how to help or donate, check out the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillerescuemission.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Rescue Mission</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.unitedwaynashville.org/\" target=\"_blank\">United Way of Nashville </a>online.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look out for deer.</strong> Deer are apparently attracted to salt, and with TDOT slathering layer upon layer of salt and brine onto the roadways this year, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12009027\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee is seeing more and more of them darting out in front of cars</a>.
