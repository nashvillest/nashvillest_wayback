Whether it&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/tag/yazoo-brewery/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsoring a tweet-up</a>, showing up to a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/YazooBrew/status/8386006374\" target=\"_blank\">city-wide snowball fight</a> with tasty, belly-warming treats, awarding prizes to their biggest fans in <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23yazooperbowl\" target=\"_blank\">Yazooperbowl</a>, tapping a single keg (and causing an internet stampede in their general direction) of <a href=\"http://yazoobrew.blogspot.com/2010/02/stout-infused-with-olive-and-sinclair.html\" target=\"_blank\">experimental chocolate stout</a> (made with local <a href=\"http://www.oliveandsinclair.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Olive &amp; Sinclair</a> chocolate, of course) or <a href=\"http://cgi.ebay.com/Yazoo-First-Pint_W0QQitemZ320490473232QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item4a9eb88710#ht_500wt_1182\" target=\"_blank\">auctioning off the first pint in their new brewery</a> on eBay, they&#x2019;ve always got something up their sleeves that makes us want more. Or maybe we just need a 12-step program.</p>\n<p>Yes, Yazoo is moving, as we&#x2019;ve discussed here at Nashvillest <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/08/yazoo-outgrows-marathon-building-heading-to-gulch/\" target=\"_blank\">in the past</a>. When they move, the first celebratory pint &amp; commemorative plaque will be awarded to the highest bidder &#x2013; Literally. Visit <a href=\"http://cgi.ebay.com/Yazoo-First-Pint_W0QQitemZ320490473232QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item4a9eb88710\" target=\"_blank\">the eBay auction</a> to throw your name (and money) into the pot, and if the bidding reaches $1,000 or more, &#xA0;you might even have a little Yazoo holiday named after you! They&#x2019;re generously donating the proceeds to charity, and will even accommodate Lenten teetotalers by making the first pint an icy glass of water if desired.</p>\n<p>Yazoo hopes to have the pub area of their new brewery in the Gulch open by the first week of &#xA0;March, so get your bids in now. We won&#x2019;t complain if someone wants to buy us our own official Nashvillest day at Yazoo either&#x2026; just sayin&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dan4th/4354183905/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>dan4th</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/18/pour-up-yazoo-tweet-up-tonight-at-the-melrose-pub/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Pour Up: Yazoo Tweet-Up Tonight At The Melrose Pub\">Pour Up: Yazoo Tweet-Up Tonight At The Melrose Pub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/08/yazoo-outgrows-marathon-building-heading-to-gulch/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Yazoo Outgrows Marathon Building, Heading To Gulch\">Yazoo Outgrows Marathon Building, Heading To Gulch</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
