Apparently we were able to host it in 1973 before were were bumped out of the loop in favor of LA and New York. Nashville won&#x2019;t actually be putting itself in the running until the completion of the new Music City Center and NCVB officials say that the convention center hotel, which is currently in limbo, would need to happen in order for us to have a chance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Parking debacle.</strong> While it could score us some major events, that fancy new convention center has <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/22651312/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">wiped out 1,200 parking spaces during the early phases of construction, causing overflow to end up in the downtown library garage</a>.
