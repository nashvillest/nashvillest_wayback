Or so we hear. Either way, Bonnaroo is always a big party, and we&#x2019;re certain that it&#x2019;ll be extra-fantastic for the big occasion. So mark those calendars, and feel free to start having sweet dreams of sweaty dance parties.</p>\n<p>Eager earlybirds can grab presale tickets to Bonnaroo &#x2019;11 <a href=\"http://www.bonnaroo.com/tickets/ticket-info.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">beginning November 26</a>, aka the infamous Black Friday. As usual, presale tickets are on a tiered pricing system, so the earlier you snag &#x2018;em, the cheaper they&#x2019;ll be! Tickets go on sale at 11AM CT, and the price will start at $209.50 before increasing to $224.50 before running out and ruining your life, and/or the presale ends.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/19/bonnaroo-2010-presale-itll-be-here-before-you-know-it/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bonnaroo 2010 Presale: It&#x2019;ll Be Here Before You Know It\">Bonnaroo 2010 Presale: It&#x2019;ll Be Here Before You Know It</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/03/bonnaroo-2009-tickets-on-sale-tomorrow/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bonnaroo 2009 Tickets On Sale Tomorrow!\">Bonnaroo 2009 Tickets On Sale Tomorrow!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/11/curing-the-bonnaroo-blues-fill-that-ticket-shaped-hole-in-your-heart/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Curing The Bonnaroo Blues: Fill That Ticket-Shaped Hole In Your Heart\">Curing The Bonnaroo Blues: Fill That Ticket-Shaped Hole In Your Heart</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/11/bonnaroo-goes-team-coco-conan-obrien-will-rule-2010-comedy-stage/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bonnaroo Goes Team Coco: Conan O&#x2019;Brien Will Rule 2010 Comedy Stage\">Bonnaroo Goes Team Coco: Conan O&#x2019;Brien Will Rule 2010 Comedy Stage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/21/zoltaroo-will-schedule-your-2010-bonnaroo-experience/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: &#x201C;Zoltaroo&#x201D; Will Schedule Your 2010 Bonnaroo Experience\">&#x201C;Zoltaroo&#x201D; Will Schedule Your 2010 Bonnaroo Experience</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
