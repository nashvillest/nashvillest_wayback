The panic started with a text message threat that circulated around the school, and then extra Metro Police officers were called in to keep things under control. School officials say that students&#x2019; nerves were already shot from learning of the shooting death of their third classmate this year yesterday.

If you&#x2019;d like to learn how to deep-fry your own turkey,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1uOqnukEQQ\" target=\"_blank\">we&#x2019;d recommend watching Coolio&#x2019;s very helpful video tutorial (probably NSFW.)</a> [<a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13558687\" target=\"_blank\">WTVF</a>]</li>\n<li>And today in Vince Young news, he apparently showed up to the team&#x2019;s Baptist Sports Park facility and was promptly asked to leave. As you might expect, he was a bit upset. He&#x2019;ll be allowed back &#x201C;at a later date.&#x201D; [<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101123/SPORTS01/101123046/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessean</a>]</li>\n<li>A West Tennessee inmate managed to slip out of jail by somehow squeezing himself between the bars of his cell. But as he&#x2019;s 5&#x2019;11&#x2033;, 165 lbs. and the bars are 4.5 inches apart, we have to say we&#x2019;re incredibly impressed. The inmate is now back in custody.
