Though no one has said what kind of cancer it is or how severe, Coach Fisher said he is &#x201C;very sick.&#x201D; [<a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13564574\" target=\"_blank\">WKRN</a>]</li>\n<li>And then there&#x2019;s Vince Young, who texted an apology to Coach Fisher for their locker room blowout. Fisher was not incredibly thrilled with the effort and told the <em>Tennessean</em>,&#xA0;&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a real big text guy. I&#x2019;m not really into this new-age stuff. I don&#x2019;t twitter or tweet, but I think face-to-face is a man thing.&#x201D; We&#x2019;re officially growing tired of this situation.

And that almost half of us don&#x2019;t really care if our Christmas sweaters are tacky? Go us.
