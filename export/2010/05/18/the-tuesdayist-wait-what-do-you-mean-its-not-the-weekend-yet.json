We thought we&#x2019;d take a few minutes to run through the highlights. Hey, Tuesday is the new hump day, right?</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B00446AD9785A07?artistid=1139200&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketmaster.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The Swell Season at the Ryman</a></strong>. <em>7</em><em>:30pm, $29.50 &#x2013; $49.50</em>. We caught The Swell Season when they came to the Ryman back in 2008, on the heels of an Oscar win with <em>Once</em>. Less than two years later, they&#x2019;re coming back to the Ryman, but it won&#x2019;t be a repeat of last time. We&#x2019;re expecting less from <em>Once</em> and more from their latest record, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Strict-Joy/dp/B002T3LHG2/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1274209585&amp;sr=301-1\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.amazon.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Strict Joy</a>, </em>which released late last year.&#xA0;And lest you think you waited too long and only the crappy seats are left, we have good news!&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B00446AD9785A07?artistid=1139200&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketmaster.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Some killer seats in the balcony</a> are still available for the show tonight. Justin Townes Earle and local singer-songwriter Sarah Siskind will open the show. We&#x2019;ll be there!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/loveyourneighbor\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">3rd Annual Love Your Neighbor Benefit</a></strong>. <em>7pm, Fellowship Bible Church, donations accepted</em>. Featuring Brandon Heath, Jason Ingram, tobymac, Mike Donehey of Tenth Avenue North and Britt Nicole, this annual fundraiser will benefit El Shaddai Church, one of many Nashville churches that suffered heavy flood damage. It&#x2019;s free (but please donate to the cause), so round up some friends and head out to Franklin for a night of music and community.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/FristCenter/status/14239450530\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;twitter.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">International Museum Day at the Frist Center</a></strong>. <em>Until 5:30pm</em>. It&#x2019;s International Museum Day, and the Frist Center is celebrating by offering free admission all day! They close at 5:30pm on Tuesdays, so you can even fit in a visit before heading to see one of the shows listed above!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/13/eat-out-for-nashville-wine-dine-for-flood-relief-flood-2010/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Eat Out For Nashville at The Patterson House</span></a></strong>. On second thought, stay far, far away.
