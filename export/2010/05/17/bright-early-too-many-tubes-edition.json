A few months ago, we congratulated Metro Nashville Public Schools for finally diving head-first into the world of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/metroschools\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/MetroSchools\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>. Now we&#x2019;re learning that they had something even bigger up their sleeves the whole time: <em>M-Tube</em>. <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=16966\" target=\"_blank\">MNPS officials have created their own version of YouTube that they plan to keep stocked with videos about some innovative and effective teaching methods</a>. Since we all know that teachers are too busy during the day to visit each other&#x2019;s classrooms, this allows them to do it virtually through this magical thing we call the internet. Please excuse us while we go try to dig up the video of the 20-foot inflatable cell with paper-m&#xE2;ch&#xE9; parts&#x2026;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wettest month on record.</strong> May 2010 <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12492846\" target=\"_blank\">officially became the wettest month </a><em><a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12492846\" target=\"_blank\">ever </a></em><a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12492846\" target=\"_blank\">for Nashville with an impressive 15.44 inches of rain on record as of last night</a>. The previous record, set in January 1937, was 14.75&#x2033;. And did we mention <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/05/57rain-storms-again/\" target=\"_blank\">it&#x2019;s supposed to rain some more this afternoon</a>?</li>\n<li><strong>We are wetlands.</strong> In a healthy dose of irony, <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/38de18a7-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee was just awarded $6.1 million for wetlands protection from the United States Department of Agriculture</a>. Does this mean we can use it to protect the entire midstate, perhaps from piranhas?</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The star-studded telethon at the Ryman Auditorium last night <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/23576354/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">raised more than $1.7 million</a> &#x2026; Bless their hearts, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100517/FEATURES02/5170304/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">we just love the Myint family so much</a> &#x2026; Vanderbilt is set to open a <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/05/14/vanderbilt-establishes-vaccine-center/\" target=\"_blank\">brand new vaccine center</a> &#x2026; &#xA0;If you&#x2019;re out in Donelson or Hermitage, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12490631\" target=\"_blank\">Roma Pizza &amp; Pasta is donating 100% of today&#x2019;s pizza sales to flood relief</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=17721\" target=\"_blank\">ICE will be conducting some audits of government contractors in Tennessee</a> to find out who&#x2019;s not hiring legally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/callrw/4613217039/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Richard Call</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
