A full meat and seafood department? A caf&#xE9; with a hot &amp; cold food bar, gelato &amp; juice bar, sandwiches prepared to order and a wide selection of prepared take-out foods? You&#x2019;ll excuse us if we can hardly believe Nashville&#x2019;s good fortune.</p>\n<p>The new Turnip Truck location, billed as Turnip Truck Urban Fare, will open at 311 12th Ave. S. (just past the Urban Outfitters on 12th) this October.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kateo/181935681/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Kate O</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/17/urban-outfitters-grand-opening-march-26-finally/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Urban Outfitters Grand Opening March 26 (Finally)\">Urban Outfitters Grand Opening March 26 (Finally)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/04/urban-outfitters-grand-opening-to-include-will-hoge-sorta-kinda-maybe/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Urban Outfitters Grand Opening To Include Will Hoge (Sorta Kinda Maybe)?\">Urban Outfitters Grand Opening To Include Will Hoge (Sorta Kinda Maybe)?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/27/the-green-wagon-gets-second-home-in-east-nashville/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Green Wagon Gets Second Home In East Nashville\">The Green Wagon Gets Second Home In East Nashville</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/02/whats-going-on-with-the-gulch/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: What&#x2019;s Going On With The Gulch?\">What&#x2019;s Going On With The Gulch?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/09/chipotle-opening-november-13-and-december-11/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Chipotle Opening November 13&#x2026; And December 11?\">Chipotle Opening November 13&#x2026; And December 11?</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
