The city has even launched a big &#x201C;Nashville Is Open&#x201D; campaign to try to let the world know that they can still come and see us, but no one seems to be listening. The president of the Nashville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau says that keeping CMApocalypse numbers up might be the biggest thing we can do to stop the &#x201C;hemorrhaging.&#x201D; So remember this as you plan your evenings out, and maybe try to show some love</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Right in between ouch and boing.</strong> Officials are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12511840\" target=\"_blank\">finally putting price tags on all the flood damages and the numbers are pretty incredible</a>. Private property damages: $1.9 billion; LP Field: $2.4 million; Schermerhorn Symphony Center: $15 million; Country Music Hall of Fame: $300,000; Bridgestone Arena: $3.1 million; hotel/motel tax losses: $3.9 million; economic losses from Gaylord Opryland events: $50 million.</li>\n<li><strong>More storms on the way.</strong> Because we just haven&#x2019;t seen enough water this month, <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/05/rain-and-storms-2/\" target=\"_blank\">we&#x2019;re due for some more &#x201C;heavy rains&#x201D; starting tonight and carrying into Saturday morning</a>. Again, nothing that&#x2019;s going to flood us again, but enough to keep us all drenched.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> No matter how many practices Chris Johnson misses, the Titans <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100520/SPORTS01/5200325/Titans+won+t+budge+on+deal+for+Chris+Johnson+\" target=\"_blank\">still aren&#x2019;t budging on his contract</a> &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2010/5/19/downtowns_free_wifi_expanding\" target=\"_blank\">free wi-fi network downtown is expanding</a>, thanks to a few businesses adding transmitters including Billy Joe&#x2019;s Tattoo &amp; Piercing &#x2026; <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=17838\" target=\"_blank\">Emergency food stamp and cash assistance for flood victims</a> has been extended one week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/neuski/4623341062/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Neuski</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
