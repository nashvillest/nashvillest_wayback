Along with leaving homes and properties in shambles, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/23661917/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">the flood also caused a record spike in unemployment according to the Tennessee Department of Labor</a>. Thanks to huge employers like the Opryland properties closing down for months to come, thousands of Tennesseans have been left without work. The Department of Labor, which usually deals with isolated disasters like tornadoes, says that normal disasters bring in around 25 unemployment claims; statewide, they&#x2019;ve had around 4,000 people file and have already approved 250. If you&#x2019;re still looking to file, a list of centers accepting claims can be found <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/23661917/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Give &#x2018;em a break.</strong> Lenders are <a href=\"http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2010/5/24/gaylord_gets_debt_waiver\" target=\"_blank\">waiving Gaylord Opryland&#x2019;s debt for the time being until they&#x2019;re able to open the hotel and convention center back up</a>, or until December 31st&#x2013;whichever comes first.

But as far as getting those temporary sites cleaned up, there is no deadline.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/23663970/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Free mental health counseling for flood victims is available all across the state</a>, funded by a special disaster relief grant &#x2026; Tennessee will be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100525/NEWS0201/5250354/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">giving flood victims a break on property taxes</a> &#x2026; The European debt crisis will probably have a <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/05/24/a-silver-lining-for-our-gas-tanks/\" target=\"_blank\">positive impact on our gas prices this summer</a> &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100525/COLUMNIST0501/5250331/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Opry kicks off its 85th birthday shindig</a> tonight at the Ryman.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/peppysis/4638272273/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Peppysis</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/03/01/bright-early-manic-tuesday-edition-2/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Manic Tuesday Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Manic Tuesday Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/01/bright-early-back-to-work-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Back To Work Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Back To Work Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/03/bright-early-the-best-policy-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The Best Policy Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The Best Policy Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
