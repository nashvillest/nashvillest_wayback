We were relieved to hear that all of the exhibits in the Country Music Hall of Fame were safe, but those in the Musicians Hall of Fame didn&#x2019;t even cross our minds. The latter, an iconic but often overlooked guardian of Music City&#x2019;s rich history, closed a month or two ago to make way for the new convention center. <a href=\"http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/05/11/joe-chambers-shares-flood-damaged-musicians-hall-of-fame-treasures/\" target=\"_blank\">All of the artifacts&#x2013;including instruments from Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Pete Townshend and Jimi Hendrix&#x2013;were placed into storage</a>. The rains came down and <a href=\"http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/05/10/musicians-hall-of-fame-future-uncertain-instruments-damaged-in-flood/\" target=\"_blank\">the storage space flooded, and now Hall of Fame founder Joe Chambers is left with the water-damaged pieces</a>. Some of the items, like Chet Atkins&#x2019; golf club walking stick, are salvageable, while others were completely pulled apart by the floodwaters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Percy Warner landfill. </strong>Neighbors are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12466147\" target=\"_blank\">understandably upset that Metro decided to turn Percy Warner Park into a temporary dumping ground for flood debris</a>. Metro maintains that they didn&#x2019;t have much of a choice, given the requirements set out by the state and federal government for things like this. Eventually, all of the trash will be moved to a real landfill.</li>\n<li><strong>MNPS damage totals.</strong> Metro Schools have tallied up their damage totals, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100512/NEWS04/5120377/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">and the official price tag will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.66 million</a>. Although the school system is already strapped for cash, director Jesse Register says it could&#x2019;ve been much worse.</li>\n<li><strong>No timeline for Opry Mills.</strong> There&#x2019;s still <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12466466\" target=\"_blank\">no real estimate for when Opry Mills will reopen, since water levels reached 10 feet inside the mall at the peak of the flood</a>. All of the wood flooring is ruined and there&#x2019;s a lot of work to be done, but no one&#x2019;s sure how long it will take. They&#x2019;ve <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=173859&amp;id=154248068483\" target=\"_blank\">posted some pictures of the clean-up on Facebook</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> A <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12466725\" target=\"_blank\">mother tells a pretty harrowing tale (and cell phone video) of being trapped</a> on I-24 during the first few hours of the flood &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100512/NEWS01/100512005/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">US and Russia seem to have worked out a deal regarding adoptions</a>, no thanks to the lady in Shelbyville who shipped her adopted kid back to Russia a few weeks ago &#x2026; Governor Phil <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=17538\" target=\"_blank\">hasn&#x2019;t exactly made it a secret that he doesn&#x2019;t like the new Guns In Bars bill</a>, but he hasn&#x2019;t said whether he&#x2019;ll veto it &#x2026; Mayor Dean and Loews Vanderbilt Hotel officials are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12467783\" target=\"_blank\">cooking up a big announcement about an investment in downtown that could bring hundreds of new jobs</a> &#x2026; Don&#x2019;t forget that Tide Loads of Hope is in town (with their own water!) and <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12468269\" target=\"_blank\">flood victims can do their laundry for free today</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/driver49/4590938216/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>schatzkins.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
