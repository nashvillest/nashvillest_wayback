These five weeks of (mostly) family-friendly films on the big screen in Centennial Park are a summer tradition we look forward to every year. Movies begin at sunset every Wednesday in June.</p>\n<p>June 2: Where The Wild Things Are (rained out)<br>\nJune 9: The Sandlot<br>\nJune 16: Legally Blonde<br>\nJune 23: The Blind Side<br>\nJune 30: Wizard of Oz<br>\nJuly 7: Where The Wild Things Are (rescheduled from June 2)</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/05/10/movies-in-the-park-2011-lineup-includes-500-days-of-summer-harry-potter-ferris-buellers-day-off-more/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Movies In The Park 2011: 500 Days Of Summer, Harry Potter, Ferris Bueller&#x2019;s Day Off &amp; More\">Movies In The Park 2011: 500 Days Of Summer, Harry Potter, Ferris Bueller&#x2019;s Day Off &amp; More</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/20/summer-must-be-here-movies-in-the-park-are-back-for-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Summer Must Be Here: Movies In The Park Are Back For 2009\">Summer Must Be Here: Movies In The Park Are Back For 2009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/20/more-than-movies-in-the-park-this-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Than Movies In The Park This Year\">More Than Movies In The Park This Year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/13/tonight-shakespeare-in-the-park-2009-kicks-off/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: Shakespeare In The Park 2009 Kicks Off\">Tonight: Shakespeare In The Park 2009 Kicks Off</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/02/schools-out-free-summer-movies-for-kids/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids\">School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
