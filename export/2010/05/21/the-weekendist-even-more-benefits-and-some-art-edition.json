Think First Saturday Art Crawl, but done up real nice (and not on the first Saturday) for flood relief. A $10 suggested donation gets you a wristband, and a wristband gets you a whole bunch of goodies, like 10% off your purchases, free vouchers for admission to the Frist Center (including the Chihuly exhibit), and other special gifts that we don&#x2019;t really know more about, but we&#x2019;re sure that they&#x2019;re great. Hors d&#x2019;oevres and beverages, the usual art crawl fare, will be served. And all proceeds from wristband sales, plus 10% from all art sales for the evening will go to the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bourbonstreetblues.com/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Hands on Nashville Fundraiser at Bourbon Street</a></strong>. <em>Bourbon Street Blues &amp; Boogie Bar, 220 Printer&#x2019;s Alley, 4pm-close, $5 cover</em>. It&#x2019;s just another Friday night with the Steve Roper Band at Bourbon Street, except half of the usual $5 cover goes to Hands on Nashville, plus matching donations made by another corporate donor.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/440695059/1029_The_Buzz_Hootenanny_with_Three_Days_Grace_Apocalyptica_Halestorm_and_multiplatinum_artists_3_Doors_Down_along_with_7dayBinge\" target=\"_blank\">Free Beer &amp; Hot Wings Hootenanny for Flood Relief</a></strong>. <em>Nashville Municipal Auditorium, 6:30pm, $20</em>. We get kind of bummed when we read about this every year, because there&#x2019;s no free beer or free hot wings. But this year we don&#x2019;t really mind, because it&#x2019;s a benefit for The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee, and many of the performing artists have donated their performance fees to lower costs and ticket prices. 3 Doors Down, November, 7 Day Binge, Halestorm, Apocalyptica and  Three Days Grace will perform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://elliesrun.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ellie&#x2019;s Run For Africa</a></strong>. <em>Percy Warner Park, 6:30am, $35.</em> Started in 2004 by 10-year-old Nashvillian Ellie Ambrose, Ellie&#x2019;s Run is in its 6th year and still going strong. Proceeds from the 5k will benefit The New Dawn School and the Emmanuel Vocational School, both of which work to educate impoverished teens in Nairobi, Kenya.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://eastnashvilleblog.com/2010/05/21/east-nashville-arts-fest-this-weekend-621/#utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed\" target=\"_blank\">East Nashville Arts Fest</a></strong>. <em>Woodland Street between 11th &amp; 12th, 11am-7pm</em>. Brand new to the East Nashville community, East Nashville Arts Fest will go down this Saturday and Sunday at Five Points. More than 50 artisan vendors from across the US will display their work, and admission is free.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nestnashville.com/news_events/spring_artisan_fair_at_edgehill_village\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Artisan Fair at Edgehill Village</a></strong>. <em>1200 Villa Place, 10am-5pm</em>. Nest Interiors and their Edgehill Village neighbors are hosting a Spring Artisan Fair, featuring sculpture, jewelry, paintings, hand-sewn bags, repurposed vintage items and more! In addition to a wide collection of artisan goods, there will be live music, delicious food, coffee tastings and beer demonstrations from local brewers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://eatatportavia.com/tnflood.html\" target=\"_blank\">The &#x201C;Bigga Meat Balla&#x201D; Spaghetti Dinner</a></strong>. <em>Porta Via Italian Kitchen, 12-5pm, $10 suggested donation</em>. Porta Via is normally closed on Sundays, but their chefs, kitchen staff and servers are donating their time to come in on Sunday and host a traditional Italian-style spaghetti dinner, raising money for Hands on Nashville. Stop in on them at 21 White Bridge Road to help out the cause and fill your belly.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://blog.hardrock.com/post/2010/05/14/Rock-Returns-To-Nashville!.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Fork The Flood Benefit</a></strong>. <em>Hard Rock Cafe, 6pm, $5 donation</em>. Yes, Hard Rock Cafe is open for business. And despite having suffered some damage themselves, they&#x2019;re hosting a Hands On Nashville benefit, and even proceeds from their Eagle Parking valet for the evening will be donated! The concert will be hosted Mindy McCready and songwriter Shawn Carnes and a number of local favorites and emerging acts will also perform.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul></ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tandemracer/4542697578/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>tandemracer</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/13/the-weekendist-benefits-upon-benefits-upon-benefits-edition-flood-2010/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Benefits Upon Benefits Upon Benefits Edition [Flood 2010]\">The Weekendist: Benefits Upon Benefits Upon Benefits Edition [Flood 2010]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/12/the-weekendist-films-basketball-beer-and-benefits-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Films, Basketball, Beer And Benefits Edition\">The Weekendist: Films, Basketball, Beer And Benefits Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/24/the-weekendist-its-getting-hot-in-here-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: It&#x2019;s Getting Hot In Here Edition\">The Weekendist: It&#x2019;s Getting Hot In Here Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/10/23/the-weekendist-all-circuits-bent-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: All Circuits Bent Edition\">The Weekendist: All Circuits Bent Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/11/the-weekendist-that-time-of-year-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: &#x201C;That&#x201D; Time Of Year Edition\">The Weekendist: &#x201C;That&#x201D; Time Of Year Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
