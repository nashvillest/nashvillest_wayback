We hope that all of you had a safe and long weekend and that none of you partook in <a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2010/07/bros-fireworking-bros-the-4th-of-july-butt-fireworks-video-guide\" target=\"_blank\">activities like these</a>. Speaking of things like that, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24147951/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville area hospitals treated more than 50 folks for fireworks-related injuries over the weekend</a>, many of which resulted from &#x201C;people playing games, firing them at each other, firing them at the neighbors, bottle rocket wars&#x201D; and people who played with them while drunk. And with a few decades of southern living under our belts, our calculations suggest that we&#x2019;ve got at least two more weeks of listening to our neighbors blow things up at all hours of the day and night, so keep those earplugs handy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Party downtown, be there. </strong>The good news is that <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12756677\" target=\"_blank\">100,000 people turned out for the city&#x2019;s weekend of July 4th festivities</a>. As with CMA, this was great news for downtown businesses who are still reeling from the flood.</li>\n<li><strong>We don&#x2019;t even know.</strong> A little further down south, folks in Columbia, TN have discovered that they have a for-real superhero living in their midst. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24146000/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Some anonymous college student has decided to dress up in spandex and drive around town looking for criminals to report</a>. When questioned by the local newspaper, he stated simply, &#x201C;I am just a guy trying to do what is right, in tights.&#x201D; We would urge you to head to source and read the entire story.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The Metro Council will <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24112183/detail.html\" target=\"_self\">vote on an ordinance that would ban tour buses from Love Circle</a>. We&#x2019;ll give you one guess about who that one&#x2019;s targeting &#x2026; It&#x2019;s tough for any Nashvillian to go through July 4th without <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12750214\" target=\"_blank\">remembering Steve McNair</a> &#x2026; If we had our little way, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/24147221/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">we&#x2019;d eat peaches everyday</a> &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12757340\" target=\"_blank\">new GM truck coming to the Spring Hill plant is just a rumor</a> &#x2026; Despite Metro&#x2019;s $250 million flood damage tally, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100706/NEWS0202/7060327/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">taxpayers shouldn&#x2019;t feel any of it</a> &#x2026; This week will be <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/07/hot-and-getting-hotter-2/\" target=\"_blank\">hot and dry</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100706/NEWS02/100706008/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">We&#x2019;ve heard this story before</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wjb13/4766703702/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wjb13</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
