We&#x2019;ve heard rumblings of some big changes in store for the heavenly patch of grass and flowers that houses our city&#x2019;s true pride and joy&#x2013;our full-scale replica of the Parthenon. Centennial Park (also home to some of our other favorite displays such as the half of a fishing boat, a plane, a clam, a Monument to Transportation, and a <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/08/where-have-all-the-catfish-gone-blast-from-the-past/\" target=\"_blank\">leftover painted catfish from that art competition a few years back</a>) will be undergoing some renovations soon and not everyone is thrilled about the proposed changes. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12856615\" target=\"_blank\">Specifically, the new plan will remove a lot of the vehicle access which many say will make it harder for folks with physical limitations and disabilities to enjoy the park</a>. Metro Parks officials say that they realize they can&#x2019;t please everyone, but they&#x2019;re trying to do what&#x2019;s best for the city.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unemployment benefits extended. </strong>President Obama <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100723/BUSINESS01/7230340/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">signed a bill extending unemployment benefits yesterday, but we&#x2019;ll have to wait about two weeks to see the effects in Tennessee</a>. The new bill restores benefits for folks who have been out of work for at least six months, but excludes anyone who has reached their 99-week maximum for benefit collection. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2010/7/22/local_job_growth_resumes\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville is seeing a pretty steady growth in the job market</a>, but job growth is still not keeping up with labor force growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Terrifying sinkhole in East Nashville.</strong> Just when we thought we were safe from sinkholes, a new one has opened up over in East Nashville on Cooper Lane. Though <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24362272/detail.html\" target=\"_self\">residents say the hole looks small from the outside, they&#x2019;re able to see about 30 feet down and it&#x2019;s only getting bigger</a> with each rain. They also claim that Metro Public Works isn&#x2019;t really helping them, though we suspect that a news story might grab their attention.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>We&#x2019;re happy to hear that <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/community/24358436/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rocketown will be opening their new location on August 5th</a> after having their last building leveled for the Music City Center &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100722/DAVIDSON/100722063/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Belmont&#x2019;s construction on the fancy new sportsplex in Rose Park is set to begin this week</a> despite the neighbors&#x2019; efforts to stop it &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12855874\" target=\"_blank\">urban chickens are at it again</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/07/heat-advisory-today-and-saturday/\" target=\"_blank\">This weekend&#x2019;s temperatures could reach record highs</a>, so pay attention to that heat advisory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisemattox/4820127111/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>niseag03</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
