Last night, Metro unveiled the much-anticipated plans for the riverfront adventure play park. Once you get past the computerized rendering filled with the Photoshopped children, it actually looks pretty fun. <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/architects-unveil-downtown-play-park-designs?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)\" target=\"_blank\">There will be a &#x201C;hollow&#x201D; for small children and a &#x201C;gorge&#x201D; for larger children (!?), a spray ground, a &#x201C;scooped misting meadow,&#x201D; a grass amphitheater and a canopy that doubles as a stage for events up to 1,200 people</a>. A&#xA0;few years down the road, they&#x2019;ll be adding a two-mile looped trail by the river, some trails, a cove, an overlook and grassy lawn. We also anticipate some great potential for new public art, which will only be acceptable if it looks like <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5581503/chicagos-new-three-story-tall-eyeball\" target=\"_blank\">this</a>. Construction is all set to start in October and in all seriousness, we&#x2019;re more than ready to see Nashville finally spruce up its riverfront.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please oh please go take some pictures.</strong> We told you there was some American Idol traffic yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12814234\" target=\"_blank\">but we didn&#x2019;t realize that 10,000 people were already camped out down there</a>. New plan: run for your lives.</li>\n<li><strong>Anti-mosque billboard posted in Rutherford</strong>. A <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12815202\" target=\"_blank\">group of former Muslims have put up a billboard out in Murfreesboro protesting the proposed new mosque that&#x2019;s drawn so much fire lately</a>. The group, <a href=\"http://formermuslimsunited.americancommunityexchange.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Former Muslims United</a>, claims they want to warn Bible Belt dwellers about the threat of Islam as a political system.</li>\n<li><strong>Oh, and early voting starts today!</strong> Find out <a href=\"http://www.nashville.gov/vote/\" target=\"_blank\">where to vote, which races to vote in, and who&#x2019;s running</a>.</li>\n<li> <strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/corps-present-flood-report-senate-committee-thursday?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Army Corps of Engineers will be telling its side of the flood story</a> today before the US Senate &#x2026; Some jerks <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12814607\" target=\"_blank\">vandalized the offices of nonprofit Youth Encouragement Services</a> and left a few thousand dollars-worth of damage and theft &#x2026; <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/07/15/state-improves-online-presence/\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee made some more improvements to their website</a> that will hopefully make it a little less difficult to use &#x2026;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wjb13/4784183245/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wjb13</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
