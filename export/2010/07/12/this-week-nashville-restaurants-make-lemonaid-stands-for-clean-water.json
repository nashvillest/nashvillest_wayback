Every year when summer rolls around, we&#x2019;re reminded of those long, hot summer days at the end of the driveway peddling $0.25 cups of lemonade to anyone who dared to walk, jog or drive past the house. Local non-profit Blood:Water Mission is <a href=\"http://www.bloodwatermission.com/lemonaid.php\" target=\"_blank\">bringing back the lemonade stand with their summer Lemon:Aid campaign</a>, inviting people all over the country to open a lemonade stand to raise money for access to clean water in Africa. What&#x2019;s the going rate for a paper cup of lukewarm lemon-sugar water these days, anyway?</p>\n<p>Between long hours at work and summer traveling, an actual lemonade stand is out of the question for many of us. But Nashville restaurants and bakeries are providing another way for us to participate in Lemon:Aid this week! <strong>Chick-fil-A</strong> and <strong>9 Fruits</strong> in Franklin, <strong>The Cocoa Tree</strong> and <strong>Cupcake Collection</strong> in Germantown, <strong>Bravo Gelato</strong> in Green Hills and East Nashville&#x2019;s <strong>March<em>&#xE9;</em></strong>, <strong>Nuvo Burrito</strong>, <strong>Silly Goose</strong> and <strong>Foxy Baking Company</strong> are all participating by selling featured Lemon:Aid items this week (today through Saturday, July 17), and a portion of the proceeds from the sales of these items will go straight to Blood:Water Mission.</p>\n<p>You don&#x2019;t have to twist our arms to get us to eat burritos, gelato and chocolate for a good cause. Visit one (or two&#x2026; or three) of the participating businesses this week, and you&#x2019;ll be supporting local businesses and a local non-profit by filling your belly with delicious, local eats. Win-win!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/07/19/local-businesses-non-profit-come-together-for-lemonaid-restaurant-week/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Local Businesses &amp; Non-Profit Come Together For Lemon:Aid Restaurant Week\">Local Businesses &amp; Non-Profit Come Together For Lemon:Aid Restaurant Week</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/22/world-water-day-walk-for-water-downtown-with-bloodwater-mission/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: World Water Day: Walk For Water Downtown With Blood:Water Mission\">World Water Day: Walk For Water Downtown With Blood:Water Mission</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/08/ridewell-this-saturday-with-bloodwater/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Ride:Well This Saturday with Blood:Water\">Ride:Well This Saturday with Blood:Water</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/29/nashvillest-spotlight-bloodwater-mission/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashvillest Spotlight: Blood:Water Mission\">Nashvillest Spotlight: Blood:Water Mission</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/25/nashville-newcomers-drinkhaus-espresso-tea/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Newcomers: DrinkHaus Espresso &amp; Tea\">Nashville Newcomers: DrinkHaus Espresso &amp; Tea</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
