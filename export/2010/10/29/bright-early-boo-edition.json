Happy Halloween! Well&#x2026; almost. Before you go busting out your crazy costumes, the <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13409329\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee Highway Patrol is reminding us all to be careful this weekend as Halloween is one of the most dangerous holidays for young kids and pedestrians</a>. So drive safe or call (or <a href=\"http://www.gofastcab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">text</a>!) a cab, watch out for kiddos and keep the party out of the streets. Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">take lots of pictures</a>. There&#x2019;s also been some confusion about when trick-or-treating is happening, so you can find out <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/25561169/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">what&#x2019;s going on in your part of town</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hopefully! </strong>Following the arrests of 26 gang members earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/25554617/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Police say they&#x2019;ve essentially destroyed the Nashville Bloods and driven the rest of the gangs into hiding</a>.

As you can imagine, this story does not have a happy ending but it&#x2019;s still worth the read.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> How&#x2019;s this for depressing? <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/25555741/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">The old Seanachie Pub could turn into a CVS</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101029/NEWS01/101029004/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">More than 700,000 absentee and early vote ballots were cast</a> during the early voting period, which ended yesterday &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/airport-launches-new-screening-equipment?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">BNA has now started using those new body scanning machines</a> that everyone loves &#x2026; The Metro Council <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/council-wants-answers-about-mta-flood-response?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">wants to know exactly why MTA employees were kept at work while the building was flooding</a> in May.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.2px;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/24503767@N07/5016892138/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\">dotsandlines</a>.</em></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
