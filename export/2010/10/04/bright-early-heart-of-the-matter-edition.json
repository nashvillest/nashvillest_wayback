John Stevenson, the owner of several neighboring properties, has launched a campaign to keep the shelter away. In reality, &#xA0;a representative from the Sophia&#x2019;s Heart Foundation (yes, that&#x2019;s Danny Gokey&#x2019;s organization) has been checking into the property for a few different projects&#x2013;only one of which is temporary housing for 10-20 homeless folks at a time&#x2013;and hopes to expand the services currently provided at the site by the Mental Health Cooperative. Mostly, they hope to create a food preparation site for off-premise distribution to homeless folks all around the city. Stevenson has put up banners in the area advertising the <a href=\"http://www.saveoureastneighborhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">campaign&#x2019;s website</a> and encouraging people to call the potential developer on his cell phone, expressing concern that the project would bring an influx of homeless into the neighborhood.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A thousand words.</strong> A <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13262060\" target=\"_blank\">Titans assistant flipped off one of the officials at yesterday&#x2019;s game</a> (which <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13260143\" target=\"_blank\">we lost</a>) and the gesture was caught on camera. The incident was kind of reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTxHuUGG_2c\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>, and the guy will probably be fined at some point (maybe only half of what Bud Adams was fined, as it was only one finger?) Anyway, Cortland Finnegan said it was awesome. The end!</li>\n<li><strong>Eats shoots and leaves.</strong> Experts are saying that thanks to our hot, dry summer, <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/3a14a52c-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">the fall leaves will probably be especially impressive this year</a>.
