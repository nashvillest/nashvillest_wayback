The host cities will be announced in mid-November.</p><ul><li><strong>Golden boy. </strong>The deputy director of the US Mint is in town today rolling out <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080814/NEWS0201/808140364/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">the new Jackson $1 coin</a> at the Hermitage.
