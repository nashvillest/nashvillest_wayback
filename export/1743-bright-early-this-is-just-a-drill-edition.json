Today is the day that the Nashville International Airport will be inciting mass panic by way of a <a href=\"http://flynashville.com/cfpress/press/MNAA_420_04082009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;full-scale disaster exercise&#x201D; involving a pretend plane crash complete with painted-up victims and emergency vehicles and helicopters and fake news crews and probably smoke bombs galore</a>. Since this will be completely visible from both I-40 and Briley Parkway, they want to make sure you know that it&#x2019;s just a drill. Since your Nashvillest editor may or may not have played the part of a fake victim in a previous &#x201C;full-scale disaster exercise,&#x201D; we can tell you that it&#x2019;ll probably be quite the spectacle. And you know what that means, Nashvillest operatives: Grab us some pictures and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">dump them in the pool</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 1,600 GM layoffs we mentioned yesterday<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090421/BUSINESS01/904210323/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\"> will definitely be affecting the Spring Hill plant</a>, but we&#x2019;re still not sure how much. We&#x2019;ve got our fingers crossed for you, Spring Hill.</li>\n<li>A guy with a carry permit <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10216845\" target=\"_blank\">fired four shots out into White Bridge Road across from Target yesterday </a>after a masked man tried to rob him in the parking lot. The suspect was fleeing the scene when the shots were fired and police determined that the shooter was within his rights.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/19233394/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">175 more people have filed lawsuits</a> against the TVA this week for the Kingston ash spill, which the TVA hopes to have dismissed by the feds &#x2026; Speaking of, here&#x2019;s a <a href=\"http://www.alexblackwelder.com/stories.html\" target=\"_blank\">really interesting photo essay about life after the spill</a> &#x2026;&#xA0; UT spent a few thousand dollars to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10215256\" target=\"_blank\">fly some folks out to Jimmy Naifeh&#x2019;s infamous Coon Supper</a> and people are angry &#x2026; The Tennessee House approved a bill that would allow people with permits to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090421/NEWS0201/904210348/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">carry guns in public parks</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rob-young/2703723994/\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Young</a>.</em></p>"
