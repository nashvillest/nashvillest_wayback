Take the kids fishing in Shelby Park, where Lake Sevier will be stocked with 1,700 pounds of catfish. No fishing licenses are necessary, and the fishing wraps before the sun comes out full force.

We&#x2019;re not sure how it&#x2019;s related, but Gildan Activewear will also be attempting to break the record for the world&#x2019;s largest t-shirt at this week&#x2019;s event, so there&#x2019;s that. You can always count on lots of food trucks, great local music and a few surprises at Musician&#x2019;s Corner.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://secure.sitemason.com/www.marthaobryan.org/crankin/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;secure.sitemason.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Miss Martha&#x2019;s Ice Cream Crankin</a></strong>&#x2018;.&#xA0;<em>Sunday, June 12 from 3-5pm,&#xA0;First Presbyterian Church (Franklin Rd), $13 adults, $10 kids</em>.
