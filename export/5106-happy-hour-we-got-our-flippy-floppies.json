It&#x2019;s finally back up and running, as Mayor Dean announced today, but let&#x2019;s not all rush out and wash our cars and/or water our lawns and/or fill our swimming pools &#xA0;and/or tap the fire hydrants for fun just yet. Metro Water officials are still asking us to give it a few days to settle out, though no one&#x2019;s going to arrest you if you want to give your car a bath (hopefully!) Speaking of, car washes can return to their normal hours starting tomorrow.

We&#x2019;re likely to hear an update from Gaylord on Wednesday about the progress that&#x2019;s been made and maybe a target date for reopening.

Since we are sort of counting on that money in light of Tennessee&#x2019;s perpetual state of broke-ness, state lawmakers say that &#x201C;all bets are off&#x201D; when it comes to state budget cuts if the federal money is off the table.
