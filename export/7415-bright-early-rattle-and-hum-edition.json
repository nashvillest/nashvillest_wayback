So how about that storm last night? Even the hard sleepers among us likely heard all the racket caused by <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/06/pre-dawn-storms-pushing-through-more-possible-later/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillewx.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">a string of severe storms that ripped through town last night, bringing some dangerous lightning, 60 mph winds and power outages with it</a>.

Though he&#x2019;s suffered from some nagging injuries lately, he&#x2019;s always been a fan favorite and a vital part of the team. Sully ensures everyone that there are no hard feelings and his family will remain in Nashville.</li><li><strong>The price is right. </strong><a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14986028/woman-charged-with-extorting-thousands-from-titans-player\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">A 22-year old woman was arrested at the corner of 31st and West End after meeting with Titans wide receiver Damian Williams and extorting $5,000 from him in exchange for not testifying against him in court</a>.
