You may have noticed that The Weekendist has been eerily absent in recent weeks, and that&#x2019;s because January and February are the most boring months EVER. Even so, it appears that Nashville is finally over the Christmas-exhaustion hump and back to business as usual, with plenty of stuff happening this weekend to keep us on our toes.</p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/15/half-price-circus-yes-please-almost-freebies/\" target=\"_blank\">Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey: Over The Top</a> at the Sommet Center, Friday-Sunday.
