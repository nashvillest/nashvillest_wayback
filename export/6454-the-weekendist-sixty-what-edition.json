The warm temps are supposed to stick around through the weekend, and if it really gets to 60 degrees on Sunday, we suggest picnics and parks for everyone (conveniently, since events this weekend are few and far between). Get outside, get some air, and enjoy a few of our top picks for this weekend:</p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillefarmersmarket.org/event/night_market\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillefarmersmarket.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Night Market</a></strong>. <em>Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market, 6-8pm, free</em>. Come down to the Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market for the first Night Market of 2011! Special menus, special vendors (Saturday-only favorites included!), cash bars, live music, samples, blend-your-own-olive-oils, hot chocolate cocktails (need we say more?) and even some appearances from &#x201C;local stars&#x201D; are on the agenda. So far we haven&#x2019;t been able to make it to any of the Night Markets, so we&#x2019;re extra excited to be able to attend this one. Many of the farmer&#x2019;s market merchants are still recovering from the flood closure, so join us and show your support!</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=907\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.fristcenter.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;The Strangeness of the Ordinary&#x201D; Film Series: Blue Velvet</a></strong>. <em>Frist Center, 7pm, free</em>.

We&#x2019;ll just go ahead and admit right now that we&#x2019;re not exactly into fishing (you would have never guessed, eh?), but for those who are, this weekend&#x2019;s Nashville Fishing Extravaganza is the place to be. Kids under 16 get in free and adult admission is only $5, and you&#x2019;ll get to see something called Slog Lake and another something called the Vicious Fishing Trophy Tank (which has never been seen before, apparently).
