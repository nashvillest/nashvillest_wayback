Your Nashvillest editors discovered the Bat Poet shortly after relocating to Nashville, flipping back and forth between whatever was on public access and weeklong <em>Made</em> marathons during caffeine-fueled college all-nighters.&#xA0;In a way, he was sort of our role model &#x2013; capturing the quirky side of Nashville for all to see. For those who never had the same late night moment of discovery, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bat+poet&amp;aq=f\" target=\"_blank\">allow us to point you to YouTube</a> to get to know our longtime friend.</p>\n<p>Cheers, Mr. Bowker. You&#x2019;ve made our years in Nashville a bit more colorful and taught us to never take ourselves too seriously. In your memory, we&#x2019;ll keep embracing all the weird that Nashville wants to throw our way.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hipnosephotography/2066891995/\" target=\"_blank\">HipNose Photography</a>. </em></p>"
