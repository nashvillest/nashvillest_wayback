In honor of CRS this week, we point you to a new study by the Country Music Association that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090306/TUNEIN/903060370/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_self\">aimed to find out exactly what kinds of folks are listening to country music</a>. Ultimately they discovered that although predominanly female and rural, it&#x2019;s a pretty diverse group spanning many ages and income brackets. However, they also figured out that their audience is mostly white, which has predictably set off a firestorm of comments on the <em>Tennessean </em>article that will probably provide at least a few hours of entertainment for this dreary-looking Friday morning.

Businesses and residents in the area expressed fears that crime would go up (can&#x2019;t imagine why!) if the station were allowed in, citing the large amount of &#x201C;incidents&#x201D; that have taken place at the current station over the last five years.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>If <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090304/TUNEIN02/903040391/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Schools are needing a bailout</a>, look no further than the Country Music Association &#x2026; State Sen.
