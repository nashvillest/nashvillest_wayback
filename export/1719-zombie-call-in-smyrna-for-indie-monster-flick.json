Alarming headlines aside, there is actually an open casting call for an independent monster movie that apparently needs a bunch of zombie extras. We have to wonder, does the director know what he&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/20/the-zombies-are-back-and-theyre-collecting-food/\" target=\"_blank\">getting</a> <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/08/weekend-edition-it-only-gets-better-from-here/\" target=\"_blank\">himself</a> <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/12/photo-of-the-day-brainz/\" target=\"_blank\">into</a>?</p><p>The <em>Tennessean </em>has this to say:</p><blockquote><p><em>Aspiring actors and/or armies of the undead are invited to report to Smyrna later this month, where the director of a new monster movie is holding an open casting call for zombie extras.</em></p><p><em>Would-be zombies will attend a Zombie Class at 119 Front St. in Smyrna from 7-8 a.m. on April 26. There, the extras will learn the ways of the undead: shambling around, groaning, fighting, devouring the brains of the living, and so forth.</em></p><p>Then it&#x2019;s on to makeup and then off to downtown Smyrna, where the movie will be shooting at the corner of 2nd Street and Jefferson Avenue until 2:30 p.m.</p><p><em>The movie in question is Dead Start, directed by George Demick.</em></p></blockquote><p>So let&#x2019;s see if we have this straight. A class to learn how to be a zombie&#x2026; And a class to learn how to <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/08/zombie-apocalypse-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" target=\"_blank\">rid the world of zombies</a>. Ahh, Nashville. You make us smile yet again.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplysteve/379625068/\" target=\"_blank\">simply steve</a>. </em></p>"}
