The Metro Transit Association has narrowly avoided a potentially disastrous bus strike after reaching an agreement with Nashville bus drivers.&#xA0; In recent weeks, drivers <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11873126\" target=\"_blank\">have been threatening to strike over a change in contract that would allow MTA to fire them after eight unplanned absences</a>. They initially implemented this rule because they actually had to hire 27 new drivers just to cover the shifts of those who called in last-minute absences, but they&#x2019;ll soon be overturning it to avoid the strike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The end of the world is nigh. </strong>In typical Tennessee fashion,<a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/01/drizzle-changes-to-snow/\" target=\"_blank\"> it was 60 degrees yesterday, hailing this morning, and will be snowing by this afternoon</a>. Hope you guys remembered your jackets!</li>\n<li><strong>Some expensive parties. </strong>A newspaper investigation revealed that <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/36d8786b-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Murfreesboro City Schools dropped $40K for wining and dining staff and members of the school board</a>, which they claim to do &#x201C;to promote fellowship and have members show up on time.&#x201D;</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Libertarians are <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2010/01/24/protest-sarah-palin-in-nashville/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+postpolitics+%28Post+Politics%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">planning a Sarah Palin protest</a> at the Tea Party convention next week &#x2026; At least 14 people <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11871257\" target=\"_blank\">ended up with gas tanks full of water </a>after stopping at a Smyrna Shell station for gas &#x2026; Glencliff High and Cameron Middle are <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/state-offers-give-charter-groups-control-two-metro-schools?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">preparing to be taken over by charter groups</a> after failing to meet No Child Left Behind benchmarks &#x2026; According to MSNBC, <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/01/22/memphis-has-beaten-us-out-of-the-recession/\" target=\"_blank\">Memphis has beaten us out of the recession</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulnich/4297290648/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Nicholson</a>.</em></p>"
