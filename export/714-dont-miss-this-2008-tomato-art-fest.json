There, we said it. We love the community, diversity and education that these festivals bring to the table, but few are executed in the best way possible. We&#x2019;ve been to many a festival that sounded promising but ended in a sub-ten minute walkthrough. In all fairness, most of these festivals face endless challenges; it&#x2019;s too hot, it&#x2019;s too cold, we&#x2019;re out of chicken, the beer tent is full, it&#x2019;s raining, our vendors didn&#x2019;t show, and so on and so forth.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Now that we&#x2019;ve got the whining out of our system, allow us to lavish praise on the <a href=\"http://www.tomatoartfest.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tomatoartfest.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Tomato Art Fest</a>. It is, hands down, the best festival of the summer. It&#x2019;s got personality, which may be why we&#x2019;re drawn to it. There&#x2019;s something about tomato artwork, costumes, vendors, food, parades, poetry and music that gives us childlike glee. There&#x2019;s no need to be an art aficionado to enjoy the tomato artwork. Some is elaborate and ornate, some is comical and frivolous, but it&#x2019;s all endlessly entertaining. We plan on spending the entire day of August 9 there, just so we don&#x2019;t miss out on any of the fun.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Vendor and participant applications are <a href=\"http://www.tomatoartfest.com/vendors.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tomatoartfest.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">due tomorrow</a>, so don&#x2019;t miss your chance to join in on the tomatoey fun. The rest of us will wait eagerly for August 9.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/22/pregaming-the-tomato-art-fest-hot-tomato-haiku-contest/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Pregaming The Tomato Art Fest: Hot Tomato Haiku Contest\">Pregaming The Tomato Art Fest: Hot Tomato Haiku Contest</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/07/this-weekend-you-say-tomato-we-say-party/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: You Say Tomato, We Say Party\">This Weekend: You Say Tomato, We Say Party</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/05/dont-miss-this-nashville-greek-festival-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Nashville Greek Festival 2008\">Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Nashville Greek Festival 2008</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/12/this-weekend-miss-martha-gets-crankin-a-little-earlier-this-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Miss Martha Gets Crankin&#x2019; A Little Earlier This Year\">This Weekend: Miss Martha Gets Crankin&#x2019; A Little Earlier This Year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/09/oktoberfest-ish-a-tale-of-two-street-fests/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Oktoberfest-ish: A Tale Of Two Street Fests\">Oktoberfest-ish: A Tale Of Two Street Fests</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
