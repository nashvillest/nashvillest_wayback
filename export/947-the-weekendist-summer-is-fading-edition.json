Enjoy them while you can, because when winter rolls around, we&#x2019;ll be trying to entertain ourselves indoors. And that&#x2019;s not nearly as much fun. But enough about winter, how about the weekend? It&#x2019;s the last weekend for the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/09/state-fair-say-wha/\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee State Fair</a>, so carve some time out of your <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/28/a-beginners-guide-to-next-big-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">Next Big Nashville</a> schedules to check out the all-sorts-of-disgusting state fair food. That&#x2019;s enough to keep us pretty busy, but for anyone who wants more, here are our top picks for the weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://style.nashvillecityblogs.com/?p=654\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;style.nashvillecityblogs.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sheryl Crow autographs at Dillards</strong></a>. If you&#x2019;re in the Cool Springs area between 11am-1pm on Friday and you happen to be a Sheryl Crow fan, swing by the Cool Springs Galleria to see if you can catch a glimpse of the singer. If nothing else, you can check out her new Bootheel Trading Co. line of clothing (which is why she&#x2019;s there in the first place). Word on the street is that you may or may not have to spend somewhere in the range of $75 on Bootheel goodies in order to get in the photo line, so we&#x2019;re not making any promises.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.conexionamericas.org/ContentPage.aspx?WebPageId=17593&amp;GroupId=4145\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.conexionamericas.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Hispanic Heritage Month Party</a></strong>.

It&#x2019;s not officially on the Next Big Nashville calendar, but the fun continues Sunday in East Nashville&#x2019;s Five Points, where The Groove, Beyond The Edge and Rumours East will be offering great food &amp; drink specials.
