Through September 7, <a href=\"http://www.sunsetgrill.com/giftcard\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.sunsetgrill.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">gift certificates good for both restaurants are 25% off</a>. You can grab a $25 gift card for around $19, a $50 gift card for $37 and some change, or a $100 gift card for a clean $75. Pair one of these babies with Sunset&#x2019;s 11am-10pm half-price Happy Hour on Wednesdays, and we could really do some serious damage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/05/super-cheap-eats-from-clear-channel/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Super Cheap Eats From&#x2026; Clear Channel?\">Super Cheap Eats From&#x2026; Clear Channel?</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
