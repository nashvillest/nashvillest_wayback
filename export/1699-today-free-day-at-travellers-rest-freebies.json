Traveller&#x2019;s Rest is tucked back off Franklin Road between the Harding &amp; Old Hickory intersections, and is home to the Overton house and plantation (which dates back to the year 1799). We think Traveller&#x2019;s Rest is often overlooked amidst the rest of Nashville&#x2019;s glitzy glammy scammy tourism hotspots, and encourage you to check it out &#x2013; But hurry, because they&#x2019;re only open until 4:30pm. Since it&#x2019;s free, there&#x2019;s nothing to lose! <em>Traveller&#x2019;s Rest is at <span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; font-size: x-small;\">636      Farrell Parkway, Nashville, TN 37220.</span></em></p>"
