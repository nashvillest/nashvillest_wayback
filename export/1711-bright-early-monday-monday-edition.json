More details continue to surface about the tornados that touched down in Murfreesboro on Friday. The EF-3 twister <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10171387\" target=\"_blank\">carried sustained winds of up to 165 mph, killed 2, injured 47, destroyed 94 homes and businesses, and damaged more than 400</a>. New mother <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10165589\" target=\"_blank\">Kori Bryant and her 9-week old daughter were killed</a> when the tornado plowed through their home, also leaving husband and father John Bryant with a punctured lung and broken back. As of this morning, John is still recovering in the hospital.<strong> The folks over at NashMash have joined friends and family to create a fund at Bank of America that will <a href=\"http://nashmash.com/bryant/\" target=\"_blank\">help carry the cost of the funerals, damage, and medical expenses for the Bryants.</a> If you&#x2019;d like to contribute, you can do so at any Bank of America, or <a href=\"http://nashmash.com/bryant/\" target=\"_blank\">online via PayPal</a>.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Never gonna give you up. </strong>Our Preds were eliminated from the playoffs on Friday night, and the <em>Tennessean</em> wishes to add insult to injury by pointing out that the franchise <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090412/SPORTS02/904120351/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">misses out on around $750K of revenue per home playoff game they would&#x2019;ve hosted</a>.</li><li><strong>Never gonna let you down. </strong>The folks in Gallatin are <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090413/NEWS01/904130322/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">starting to question how the TVA ash ponds in their community would hold up in the case of a flood</a>. The ponds are all situated on floodplains, which the TVA says is not a problem, but oddly enough, the TVA doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a real credible source these days.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The severe weather onslaught continues this afternoon and evening with the <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2009/04/13/severe-weather-threat-returns/\" target=\"_blank\">threat of heavy storms and hail</a> &#x2026; According to the latest report released by the Metro PD, <a href=\"http://sylvanpark.blogspot.com/2009/04/mnps-2008-crime-statistics-online.html\" target=\"_blank\">crime is actually down this year</a> in Nashville &#x2026; Easter was a little different from expected for <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10171257\" target=\"_blank\">one Murfreesboro congregation</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090412/BUSINESS01/904120361/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Office space</a>?
