As much as we&#x2019;d love a snow day, we&#x2019;re pretty glad we&#x2019;re not part of the 500,000 folks in Tennessee and Kentucky who are stuck without power for the next few days. NES is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9752379\" target=\"_blank\">lending a few of their workers out to Kentucky</a> to try and get things back up and running a little more quickly, but we can imagine that it probably still sucks. So far, this week&#x2019;s ice storm is being <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9752604\" target=\"_blank\">blamed for three deaths</a>. Our hearts go out to all the folks affected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whoops!</strong> Ron Littlefield, Mayor of the &#x2018;Noog, had to call up Volkswagen and apologize for <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/2d64c4c3-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">using their logo on his campaign literature</a> without permission. By the way, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ronlittlefield\" target=\"_self\">the mayor is on Twitter now</a> so head over there and give him a hearty welcome (we only wish our mayor was that cool)!</li>\n<li><strong>Money would be good. </strong>If the economic stimulus plan goes through, Tennessee <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/2564c4bf-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">would be getting upwards of $1 billion</a>. Though we&#x2019;re sort of surprised that $600M of that would go to TDOT, the $350M set aside for schools seems like a good idea to us.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>A Tennessee judge denied a death row inmate&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=65723\" target=\"_blank\">attempt to delay his execution</a> which is scheduled for next week &#x2026; Oh, good&#x2013;Duke University scientists found <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18594383/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">high levels of arsenic and radioactive radium</a> in the sludge they&#x2019;re trying to scoop up in Kingston &#x2026; The Tennessee House Ethics Committee has <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090129/NEWS0201/901290361\" target=\"_blank\">decided to throw out the sexual harassment charges</a> against Speaker Kent Williams brought by Rep. Susan Lynn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by&#xA0; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimbenttree/3224529136/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">jimbenttree</a>.</em></p>"
