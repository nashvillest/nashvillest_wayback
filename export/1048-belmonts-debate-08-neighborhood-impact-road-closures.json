We&#x2019;re still recommending you steer clear of the general area if you can unless 3,000 members of the media, traffic-stopping motorcades, and a ton of Secret Service are your thing. Your best bet is to find a watch party (and believe us, <a href=\"http://www.belmontdebate08.com/party_participants\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.belmontdebate08.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">there are plenty</a>)&#xA0; or hole yourself up in your house for the night.
