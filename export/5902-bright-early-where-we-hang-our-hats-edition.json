With all of those fancy new high-rise condos going up around town, a few Metro Council members are concerned that affordable housing is becoming too difficult to come by. Last night, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101020/NEWS01/10200386/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Councilman Jerry Maynard filed a bill that would offer incentives to developers who create housing that can be purchased for less than $154,000</a>. The proposed incentives include 25% discounts on fees for sewer, gas, plumbing and electricity hook-ups in addition to 25% off building permit fees. So far, Mayor Dean is behind the bill and feels that it&#x2019;s needed in order to keep folks from moving to surrounding counties with cheaper housing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nearly 400 Metro students were <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/health/25443136/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">sent home this week for not meeting the new vaccination requirements for school childre</a>n.
