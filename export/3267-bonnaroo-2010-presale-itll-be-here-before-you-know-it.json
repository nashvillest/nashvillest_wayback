The 2010 festival dates have just been announced, and ticket presales will start next Friday, November 27 at 11am CST.</p><p>Bonnaroo 2010 will happen June 10-13, and if you get in on the <a href=\"http://www.bonnaroo.com/tickets/ticket-info.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">holiday presale</a>, your ticket will only run $209.50 instead of the $249.50 that those noncommittal friends of yours will end up shelling out later. The cheap tickets are available in limited increments and increase in price until they reach $249.50, or until the presale ends on December 31.</p><p><strong>tl;dr: Buy your tickets as soon as they go on sale to get the cheapest price. </strong><a href=\"http://www.bonnaroo.com/tickets/ticket-info.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for ticket information and a purchase link</a>.</p><p><em>Hat tip to <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleistalking.com/2009/11/bonnaroo-announces-2010-festival-dates/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Is Talking</a> and </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/Bonnaroo/status/5863190240\" target=\"_blank\"><em>@Bonnaroo</em></a><em> for the heads up.</em></p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kloppster/2592447709/\" target=\"_blank\">kloppster</a>.</em></p>"}
