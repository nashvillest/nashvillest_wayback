We can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;re still talking about the Guns in Parks bill, but yesterday the <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=11662\" target=\"_blank\">State Attorney General made a few more clarifications about the ways in which the new law can and can&#x2019;t be enforced</a>. The verdict? If you tote a gun in a city that&#x2019;s chosen to opt out of the law and ban guns in parks, you can still be charged under state law even if there are no signs posted. However, you&#x2019;re welcome to drive through a park with a gun as long as you stay in the car. Easy enough, right?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Airport fees increase. </strong>Because BNA chose to stop bringing in cargo-carrier China Air, they may be <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=11627\" target=\"_blank\">raising the rent on the rest of the airlines that fly into the airport</a>.
