Local cyclists are complaining that <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/sewer-grates-across-city-dangerous-cyclists?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Metro isn&#x2019;t responding quickly enough to the need to replace non-bike-friendly storm drains that have caused serious accidents around the city</a>. Grates whose openings are parallel to the streets can swallow up bike tires and cause cyclists to flip over their handlebars, as has happened in the past and resulted in some pretty hefty lawsuits against Metro. And although some of the grates have been replaced with others that have slats facing perpendicular to the street, there are still enough of the parallel grates to cause a problem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bridge to nowhere.</strong> Omni and Metro officials are trying to decide <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/will-hotel-and-convention-center-be-linked?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)\" target=\"_blank\">whether a proposed sky bridge connecting the new convention center to the convention center hotel is worth shelling out $5-$15 million</a>, and who would pay for it.</li>\n<li><strong>Bad communication.</strong> In case you&#x2019;re still wondering what went wrong during the May flood, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101017/NEWS01/10170364/-1/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">the Tennessean hashes out the timeline explaining which communications broke down and where</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> A Tennessee company is <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/25415843/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">yanking certain bags of frozen vegetables because there may be broken glass in them</a> &#x2026; Just when we thought the construction traffic on I-40 around White Bridge might be cleared up, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/traffic/25391111/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">they&#x2019;re starting another big project</a> &#x2026; We might get <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/10/a-warm-monday-ahead-some-rain-on-tuesday/\" target=\"_blank\">some of that much-needed rain this week</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13336691\" target=\"_blank\">Dairy King is finally back open</a> for the first time since the flood &#x2026; <em><a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/nashville-ranked-seventh-most-dangerous-city?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes</a></em><a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/nashville-ranked-seventh-most-dangerous-city?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\"> lists Nashville as the 7th most dangerous city in the country</a> &#x2026; The Tennessee Department of Correction is <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101018/NEWS01/10180330/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">working hard to keep sex offenders in line on Halloween</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34609907@N05/5027933436/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>sleepy rabbit</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
