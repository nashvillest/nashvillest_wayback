Unless you&#x2019;ve lived under a rock for the past couple of years, most of us have a pretty good idea of how difficult the job market has been. The summer job market has also been hit pretty hard by the recession, since a lot of professional adults have had to clamor for retail and food service work to make ends meet after layoffs and downsizing. This, in turn, has left teens without a whole lot of options. <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/07/07/get-a-job-kid/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;business.nashvillepost.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">A new study estimates that summer jobs are down almost 30% from what they were at this time last year</a>, which tells us we&#x2019;re not out of the woods yet.
