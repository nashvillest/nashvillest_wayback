Been to the Shelby Street pedestrian bridge lately? Apparently it <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/17550686/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news#\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">smells like urine, vomit, and alcohol</a>.
