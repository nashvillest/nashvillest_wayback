Change is coming to the downtown branch of the Nashville Public Library in February. For some reason they&#x2019;ve decided that <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/18560730/detail.html#-\" target=\"_blank\">opening a &#x201C;Teen Wing&#x201D; with a Wii and four giant plasma TVs </a>in the middle of a library is a good idea. They say they&#x2019;re doing it to encourage teens to start using the library (but seriously, haven&#x2019;t these people ever heard of <em>the internet</em>!?) and it&#x2019;ll be closed in with four walls to contain all the noise. Not to be raining on anyone&#x2019;s parade or anything, but we sort of have to wonder how many Voluntary Metro Employee Furloughs it&#x2019;s going to take to fund this thing. Just sayin&#x2019;.</p><ul><li><strong>Bob that what? </strong>We never thought we&#x2019;d see the day with <a href=\"http://blog.cmt.com/2009-01-23/jessica-simpson-greenville-or-bust/\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Simpson would be opening for a Rascal Flatts tour</a>, but that day has arrived.
