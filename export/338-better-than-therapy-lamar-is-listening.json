We&#x2019;re always looking for new ways to whine about how we&#x2019;re having to ride our bikes everywhere and figure out how to take the bus to work, which is why we were happy to hear that Senator Lamar Alexander <a href=\"http://knoxvilletalks.com/2008/06/09/lamar-alexander-wants-to-hear-your-gas-story/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/http://knoxvilletalks.com/2008/06/09/lamar-alexander-wants-to-hear-your-gas-story/&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">wants to hear about it</a>. He sent out an email to his constituents (which would be us) actually asking for our really sad gas stories so that he can share them with the folks in Washington.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#x2026; So I am asking for your help. I&#x2019;d like to share your stories about the impact high gas prices are having on your lives, so my colleagues in the Senate can better understand how real people in Tennessee are coping with these escalating costs. Tennessee families cannot ignore rising gasoline prices, and your stories could help convince Washington lawmakers to stop ignoring this crisis. &#x2026;</p></blockquote>\n<p>He even created a special email address for the occasion. If you have a story of your own or just need to blow off some steam, drop him a line at <a href=\"mailto:gasprices@alexander.senate.gov\">gasprices@alexander.senate.gov</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/micahd/2507143256/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/http://flickr.com/photos/micahd/2507143256/&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">micah.d</a>.</em></p>"
