We usually end up wimping out and not going to any Christmas shows, but we know we&#x2019;re missing out. Over the next couple days, we&#x2019;ll be highlighting some of the more interesting Christmas shows that just might be worth dragging ourselves out of the house and into the drizzle for some holiday cheer.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Our pick today is Tennessee Rep&#x2019;s <em><a href=\"http://tennesseerep.org/santaland.php\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/tennesseerep.org&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Santaland Diaries</a></em>. We&#x2019;re big fans of David Sedaris (who isn&#x2019;t?) and anything he writes has got to be brilliant on stage. <em>Santaland Diaries</em> is a one-man show about an unemployed bum who gets a seasonal job as an elf at Macy&#x2019;s. Enough said. Unfortunately, time is running out to catch this show before it takes off (until next year, we hope). It&#x2019;s running through this weekend, and tickets are available <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/TN-Perf-Arts-Ctr-Andrew-Johnson-Theater-tickets-Nashville/venue/221348\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.ticketmaster.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Remaining showtimes:</p>\n<p>Wed., Dec. 17, 6:30 PM<br>\nThurs., Dec. 18, 6:30 PM<br>\nFri., Dec. 19, 7:30 PM<br>\nSat., Dec. 20, 2:30 PM<br>\nSat., Dec. 20, 7:30 PM</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/19/the-weekendist-is-it-really-december-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Is It Really December Edition\">The Weekendist: Is It Really December Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
