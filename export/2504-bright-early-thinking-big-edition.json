It might sound simple, but they have created a group called <a href=\"http://www.thekeyalliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Key Alliance</a> that aims to raise close to $72 million to provide some additional housing and support services for Nashville&#x2019;s homeless. The alliance will eventually include government, business, and non-profit organizations interested in fighting the problem, and the entire plan will span about 10 years. Though it sounds a little ambitious, a similar plan was enacted in Denver and reduced chronic homelessness by 36% and overall homelessness by 11%.</p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><strong>So you had a bad day.</strong> Only a couple of days after he was picked up while careening drunk down Broadway, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10983453\" target=\"_blank\">Titans receiver Chris Davis has been released due to a hamstring injury</a>.
