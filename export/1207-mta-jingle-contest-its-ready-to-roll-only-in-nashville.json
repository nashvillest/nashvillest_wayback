Nashville musician Geoff Smith has penned and recorded the winning tune, and it&#x2019;s a good time. Despite some cheesy lyrics, the jingle is actually really catchy, and we&#x2019;re pretty glad Geoff won. Besides, it would be impossible to write a song about riding the bus without being just a <em>little</em> cheesy. Besides being a kickass jingle-writer, Geoff is also the keyboardist in <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/codaphonic\" target=\"_blank\">Codaphonic</a>, one of our favorite local acts.&#xA0;92 would-be jingle-writers entered the contest (we&#x2019;d give anything to hear the other 91).</p>\n<p>Drumroll, please&#x2026; Here&#x2019;s the winning entry and lyrics:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;\n</p><p class=\"audioplayer_container\"><span style=\"display:block;padding:5px;border:1px solid #dddddd;background:#f8f8f8\" id=\"audioplayer_1\">Audio clip: Adobe Flash Player (version 9 or above) is required to play this audio clip.
