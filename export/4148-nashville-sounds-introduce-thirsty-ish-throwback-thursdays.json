The Nashville Sounds will introduce &#x201C;Throwback Thursdays&#x201D; this year, offering hot dogs, pretzels, nachos, sodas and, yes, beer (!) for just $2 each. While it&#x2019;s a 100% markup on the $1 beers we used to guzzle on Thirsty Thursdays, we really can&#x2019;t complain about this.</p><p>Individual tickets for this season <a href=\"http://nashvillesounds.com/news/news.asp?newsId=3234\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillesounds.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">go on sale</a> this Tuesday, March 16. The Sounds are also offering new ticket flex packs of undated vouchers, so you can use your tickets whenever and with whomever you please.
