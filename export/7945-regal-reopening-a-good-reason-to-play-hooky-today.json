Of course we&#x2019;d <em>never</em> recommend that our readers skip out on work, but if, you know, you just happen to get sick or something, we know just the ticket to recovery &#x2013; $2 movies!</p><p>Both today and tomorrow (and yesterday, but let&#x2019;s not dwell on our failure to inform you), head out to Opry Mills to catch $2 flicks while stuffing your skull with $2 popcorn and soda. It&#x2019;s for a good cause! Each day of the week benefits a local nonprofit, so round up your friends (after work, if you must) and take a big crowd. Special selections each day join a lineup of the past year&#x2019;s blockbusters, so you can catch up on what you missed while the theater was closed.</p><p>Today&#x2019;s special &#x201C;Red Carpet&#x201D; selections benefit our friends at the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillefilmfestival.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Film Festival</a>, and include a few films we had the pleasure of seeing at this year&#x2019;s fest:</p><ul><li>The Artist [PG-13] &#x2013; 7:15, 10:10</li><li>My Week With Marilyn [R] &#x2013; 7:00, 9:50</li><li>Weekend [NR] &#x2013; 1:05, 4:20, 7:05, 9:30</li><li>The First Grader [PG-13] &#x2013; 12:55, 4:25, 7:20, 10:25</li></ul><p>Tomorrow&#x2019;s special selections will get you in the holiday spirit and benefit Second Harvest Food Bank:</p><ul><li>Fred Claus [PG] &#x2013; 12:40, 4:10, 7:15, 10:10</li><li>How The Grinch Stole Christmas [PG] &#x2013; 1:00, 4:15, 7:00, 9:50</li><li>Four Christmases [PG-13] &#x2013; 1:05, 4:20, 7:05, 9:30</li><li>Disney&#x2019;s A Christmas Carol [PG] &#x2013; 12:55, 4:25, 7:20, 10:25</li></ul><p>If none of these tickle your fancy, all of the following films are showing through Wednesday the 16th (<a href=\"http://www.regmovies.com/cinemas/OpryMillsStadium20.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">times here</a>) and also benefit the nonprofits above:</p><p>Soul Surfer, Zookeeper, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Super 8, Green Lantern, Fast Five, Bridesmaids, X-Men: First Class, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Captain America, Cars 2, Thor, The Hangover 2, Crazy Stupid Love, Cowboys &amp; Aliens, Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3D, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (IMAX 3D)</p><p>Welcome back, IMAX.
