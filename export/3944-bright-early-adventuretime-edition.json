We keep getting more and more intrigued by this whole idea of an &#x201C;Adventure Play Park&#x201D; being built on the east bank of the Cumberland. <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11966482\" target=\"_blank\">So far we&#x2019;ve heard talk of water jets, rock climbing walls, wading pools and an amphitheater</a>, but we&#x2019;re having a little trouble visualizing such a thing. What we do know is that it will span about 7 1/2 acres, they still need to acquire almost 300 parking spaces from LP Field, and it&#x2019;s supposed to be open by summer 2011. The park is supposedly part of a massive effort by the Dean administration to revitalize both sides of the riverfront.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>City with a big heart.</strong> After the vandalism at the Al-Farooq Islamic Center of Nashville yesterday, we&#x2019;re happy to hear that <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/community-reaches-out-local-islamic-center-after-hate-crime?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;Tim,&#x201D; an unemployed truck driver from East Nashville, stopped by yesterday with some paint and helped with the cleanup</a>. The full text of the nasty note was also released and it was about what you might expect, waxing poetic about Moslems [sic] and Satan. The vandalism is being investigated by the FBI as a hate crime.</li>\n<li><strong>Tent City meetings.</strong> The Metro Homelessness Commission met about Tent City again yesterday and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11968386\" target=\"_blank\">didn&#x2019;t get a whole lot further in their efforts to figure out a solution for the homeless encampment</a>. So far, they&#x2019;re still looking at either moving it or shutting it down.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> January was the 20th straight month that <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/states-holiday-sales-tax-revenues-below-budget?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee&#x2019;s sales tax revenue collections were below budget</a> &#x2026; Tennessee-based restaurant chain Cracker Barrel was <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2010/02/10/cracker-barrel-rated-as-unfriendly-to-gays/\" target=\"_blank\">ranked as the third-worst employer for gays</a> by the Human Rights Campaign &#x2026; Councilman Eric Crafton announced yesterday that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100211/NEWS0202/2110341/Councilman+Eric+Crafton+to+seek+court+clerk+s+job\" target=\"_blank\">he&#x2019;ll be running for Juvenile Court clerk</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bradbutcher/4156297942/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Butcher</a>.</em></p>"
