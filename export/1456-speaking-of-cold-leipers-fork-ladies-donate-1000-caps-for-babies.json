Collectively, they knit over 500 caps for newborn babies as part of Save The Children&#x2019;s <em><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org/programs/health/child-survival/survive-to-5/knit-one-save-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Knit One, Save One</a></em> campaign, and donated an additional 500 machine-made caps as well. Senator Frist even showed up at their church to recognize their dedication to the project.</p>\n<p>Save The Children&#x2019;s <em>Knit One, Save One</em> campaign urges those of us privileged enough to have warm clothes and a roof over our head to share a little, by knitting or crocheting simple, tiny hats that could save the life of a newborn baby in a developing country. This year&#x2019;s deadline for sending a hat has been extended to January 31, so there&#x2019;s still time to dust off those knitting needles and get to work! Most of the caps should take even a beginner knitter less than a couple of hours. <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org/programs/health/child-survival/survive-to-5/knit-one-save-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Participation information &amp; Action Kit here</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>So if you&#x2019;re cold in Nashville today, consider warming up your hands and whipping up a cap for <em>Knit One, Save One</em>.&#xA0;And if you can&#x2019;t knit, well, that&#x2019;s okay too &#x2013; a storebought cap is just fine.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo from </em><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org/programs/health/child-survival/survive-to-5/knit-one-save-one.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hope Through Healing Hands</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
