It&#x2019;s easy and convenient for most of us (depending on where your nearest satellite voting location is) and saves the hassle, the lines and the political hecklers on election day. What&#x2019;s not to like? In our case, the nearest early voting location is actually closer than the location we&#x2019;re zoned for on election day, so it&#x2019;s a win-win for us. And we hope it&#x2019;s a win-win for our readers too. Early voting will end on October 30, so there&#x2019;s a few weeks of procrastination before the lines start to get bad.
