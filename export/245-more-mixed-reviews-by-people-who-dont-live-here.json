It gives us something to talk about.</p>\n<p>This week, Nashville has been ranked the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24843322/page/2/\" target=\"_blank\">4th friendliest city</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008804120349&amp;template\" target=\"_blank\">2nd highest incarceration</a> rate,and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8394345\" target=\"_blank\">6th worst for carbon</a> emissions.

We are also the 11th most <a href=\"http://vortek.home.mindspring.com/t20cities02.htm\" target=\"_blank\">tornado-prone</a> city with a population over 100,000 in July. Whatever that means.</p>\n<p>Nashvillest is thinking about doing some studies off our own, maybe &#x201C;Highest Occupancy Rate Of Has-Been Pop Stars&#x201D; to start off.</p>"
