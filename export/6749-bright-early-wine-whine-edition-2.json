We&#x2019;ve been hearing some buzz this year about the wine in grocery stores debate coming back to the forefront in the legislature. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/27341763/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\">Turns out lawmakers are considering several proposals that could at least get us a little closer to being able to buy wine in the grocery store like normal people</a>. Option one would simply allow grocery stores to sell wine like any other product. Option two would allow them to sell wine as long as it&#x2019;s only consumed in the store (Bar Kroger, anyone?!) Option three would allow localities to vote on it.</p><ul><li><strong>Minorities on the rise. </strong>According to the latest US Census data, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110328/NEWS01/103280344/2275/rss05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\">minorities now make up almost 60% of the youth population in Davidson County</a>. In Rutherford County, whose overall population has just about doubled in the last ten years, 32% of those under 18 are minorities.</li><li><strong>Symphony finally gets some new pianos. </strong><a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=25425\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;wpln.org&apos;]);\">The Nashville Symphony has already replaced one of the Steinway grand pianos they lost in the flood last year, and the second is on its way from Hamburg, Germany</a> and will hopefully be in Nashville sometime next month. With the exception of some remaining work on the pumping system, they&#x2019;ve nearly made a full recovery.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=25109\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;wpln.org&apos;]);\">A species of salamander that only lives in Tennessee caves warrants federal protection</a>, according to US Fish and Wildlife, but it won&#x2019;t be added to the endangered species list just yet &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14330200/nashville-hosts-3rd-annual-cherry-blossom-festival\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The Nashville Cherry Blossom Festival/Japan Relief event went off without a hitch</a> &#x2026; A brand new Mobile Market food truck featuring fresh produce has been <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14330859/mobile-market-provides-nashvillians-with-healthy-food-options\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">making the rounds around some parts of town that don&#x2019;t have much access to healthy food</a>, thanks to the Frist Foundation &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/tennessee-makes-quick-work-search-hires-pearls-replacement?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-Sports+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Sports%29\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">University of Tennessee hired a replacement coach</a> and it was not Rick Byrd &#x2026; Parents and students at Hillsboro High School are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14330655/students-and-parents-rally-for-award-winning-teacher\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">fighting the transfer of a beloved teacher to another school</a>.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashtonchristine/5553177221/in/pool-715021@N24/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ashton Ballard</em></a>.</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/02/why-not-wine-wheres-our-two-buck-chuck/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Why Not Wine: Where&#x2019;s Our Two Buck Chuck?\">Why Not Wine: Where&#x2019;s Our Two Buck Chuck?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/26/bright-early-wine-whine-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Wine Whine Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Wine Whine Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/02/11/bright-early-some-cheese-with-that-whine-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Some Cheese With That Whine Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Some Cheese With That Whine Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/16/bright-early-just-like-fine-wine-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Just Like Fine Wine Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Just Like Fine Wine Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/28/tonight-graces-plaza-wine-spirits-grand-opening/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: Grace&#x2019;s Plaza Wine &amp; Spirits Grand Opening\">Tonight: Grace&#x2019;s Plaza Wine &amp; Spirits Grand Opening</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
