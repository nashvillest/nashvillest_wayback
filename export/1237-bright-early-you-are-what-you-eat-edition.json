Bought any frozen chicken lately? A new study by the Food Safety Task Force just found out that on average, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/health/17912065/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news#-\" target=\"_blank\">10% of the chicken in Tennessee grocery stores carries salmonella</a>. They&#x2019;ve started buying 10 bags of chicken per week from various Middle Tennessee grocery stores, and &#x201C;the results have shown that sometimes half the chicken is tainted and sometimes none of it.&#x201D; That doesn&#x2019;t really inspire much confidence if you know what we mean. For the record, you can avoid the problem by making sure you cook it well before you eat it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three cheers.</strong> Let&#x2019;s all take a moment this morning to remember our brothers and sisters in Nolensville who <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9300316\" target=\"_blank\">can finally have bars in town</a>. Yesterday, the folks in Nolensville voted for the right to sell liquor by the drink, which was holding up progress for a number of businesses looking to relocate there.</li>\n<li><strong>Three&#x2019;s a crowd</strong>. Speaking of alcohol, liquor stores in town think that Green Hills is getting a little crowded, and are suing to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081106/NEWS03/811060344/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">prevent a third liquor store</a> from opening in the area. We say the more the merrier, but Bud&#x2019;s and the Green Hills Wine Shoppe think otherwise. &#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Applications are available for Metro&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9301675\" target=\"_blank\">heating assistance program</a> for those who need it &#x2026; The public hearing to determine whether chain restaurants will have to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9300341\" target=\"_blank\">disclose nutrition information</a> on their menus is today &#x2026; A road project in Williamson County has resulted in an astonishing <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/17916586/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">four deaths in the past year</a>, and has finally been suspended.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/mrhappy8/494057053/\" target=\"_blank\">mrhappy8</a>.</em></p>"
