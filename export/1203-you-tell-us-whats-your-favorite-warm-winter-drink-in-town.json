A few local coffee shops have concocted delicious warm beverages just for this type of weather, but we want to know what YOUR favorites are (and yes, alcoholic drink suggestions are more than welcome). Is it Crema&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/bites/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/blogs.nashvillescene.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Mayan Hot Chocolate</a>? Bongo Java&#x2019;s &#x201C;Apple Pie&#x201D; Cider? Or are you a sucker for Starbucks&#x2019; Pumpkin Spice Latte? And while we&#x2019;re at it, does anywhere in this town serve a great hot buttered rum?&#xA0;</p>\n<p>You&#x2019;re welcome to share drinks you enjoy at home, but mega bonus points if it&#x2019;s available at a Nashville coffee shop, restaurant or bar.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/urlgirl/55894370/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>urlgirl</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/04/coffee-cupcakes-update/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Coffee &amp; Cupcakes Update\">Coffee &amp; Cupcakes Update</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
