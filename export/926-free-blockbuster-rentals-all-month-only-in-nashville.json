Blockbuster is celebrating its 20th year in town by heaping free rentals into our outstretched palms. For the entire month of September, any non-new release rental is free at Blockbuster (limit 1 per customer per day). No other rental is required, and Williamson County stores are participating too. We think this is a pretty generous way to celebrate 20 years in town, and we may have to put our Netflix accounts on hold for the month while we take advantage of Blockbuster&#x2019;s little reminder that they still exist.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/jlmaral/356217080/\" target=\"_blank\">jlmaral</a>. </em></p>"
