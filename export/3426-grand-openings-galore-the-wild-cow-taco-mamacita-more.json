Last weekend we saw <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/03/flatrock-cafe-bringing-caffeine-community-to-nolensville-road-nashville-newcomers/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Flatrock Cafe</strong></a> open their doors (with nothing but rave reviews pouring in through the comments), and this week the tasty fun continues.</p>\n<p><strong>Pad Thai Kitchen</strong> opened Monday, December 7 in its new location at 604 Gallatin Avenue, just a stone&#x2019;s throw (okay, a couple miles) away from its former location on Woodland Street. Hours are Monday through Thursday 11am-9pm, Friday &amp; Saturday 11am-10pm and Sunday 12pm-8pm.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://eatatportavia.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;eatatportavia.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Porta Via Italian Kitchen</a></strong> held their grand opening party last night at&#xA0;21 White Bridge Road (the old Bellacino&#x2019;s location), and we&#x2019;ve already taken the liberty of sinking our teeth into some of their delicious offerings. If the name sounds familiar, you might remember them from their Bellevue days. The new reincarnation boasts a wide variety of fresh italian food, including authentic wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://tacomamacita.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;tacomamacita.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Taco Mamacita</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">,</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> brought to us by our neighbors in Chattanooga, finished remodeling the old Rosario&#x2019;s space at 1200 Villa Place yesterday, and they&#x2019;re ready to throw open their doors for a grand opening tomorrow, December 10. They open at 11am, and will serve lunch &amp; dinner every day. We&#x2019;ve written about Taco Mamacita before, so if you want to know more, head over <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/21/taco-mamacita-will-spice-up-edgehill-village-nashville-newcomers/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">UPDATE</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">: Taco Mamacita&#x2019;s opening has been pushed back one day to December 11. </span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/tag/chipotle/\" target=\"_blank\">Chipotle</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/tag/chipotle/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>&#x2018;s</strong></a> second Tennessee location, conveniently located in Green Hills, will open to the public on Friday, December 11. A few lucky local students will get some free food and a sneak peek before then, though! Students of Hillsboro High School can get free dinner tonight from 5-8pm, and any Lipscomb students (K-12 &amp; university) can score the same deal tomorrow. Same time, same place, and if you were thinking about trying to pass yourself off as a Lipscomb student, think again &#x2013; They&#x2019;ll be checking ID&#x2019;s. If you&#x2019;re not a student and want a shot at free food, get ready to stand in line. The first 100 people at 3pm on Friday will get t-shirts and free burrito coupons, and there will be a free-burritos-for-a-year drawing (the restaurant is open from 11am-10pm). </span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.thewildcow.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.thewildcow.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The Wild Cow</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> will begin serving food this week, and they&#x2019;re throwing a grand opening party on Saturday, December 12 from 5-9:30pm. A $10 donation gets you all-you-can-eat samples of most of their menu items, as well as a glass of hard cider or wine. And that $10 donation? 75% goes to benefit East C.A.N., a local nonprofit.
