Have you ever stood in line with 200 other people trying to put random multiples of $0.31 on a credit card? We did last year, and it was barely worth the price break&#x2026; But yet, we&#x2019;ll go back again tonight! And we hear that you can get up to three scoops per person per time in line, so for $0.93, we&#x2019;ll make it <em>really</em> worth our while.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of Baskin Robbins all over Nashville &amp; Franklin, so visit their <a href=\"http://www.baskinrobbins.com/StoreLocator/PrxResults.aspx?hdnLatitude=36.0953&amp;hdnLongitude=-86.8266&amp;hdnType=ByLocation&amp;rdoUnit=Mi&amp;txtPostalCode=37215&amp;txtAddress=&amp;txtCity=&amp;selStateProvince=&amp;txtDistance=15&amp;txtMatchesperPage=5\" target=\"_blank\">store finder</a> to find the closest one.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/oyf/356648289/\" target=\"_blank\">owaief89</a>.</em></p>"
