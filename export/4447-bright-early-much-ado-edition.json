The <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=16513\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee House and Senate both passed resolutions yesterday opposing the new federal health care program</a>. The House version, sponsored by Rep. Susan Lynn and debated for two full hours, asked Congress not to pass the overhaul which actually passed several weeks ago. Rep. John DeBerry bowed out of the vote, choosing instead to hang out at his desk because he felt that debating something that already passed for two hours was &#x201C;the very reason that folks think we&#x2019;re out of our minds in this House.&#x201D; The Senate resolution asked the State Attorney General to sue the feds over the program on the grounds that it&#x2019;s unconstitutional.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abortion ban passes House. </strong>The Tennessee House also <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=16499\" target=\"_blank\">passed a ban on any abortion coverage that becomes available under the new federal health care program</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Dirty dirty Sanchez. </strong>Moving onto More Important Matters, however, the <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/metro-council-considers-allowing-beer-taco-mamacita?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Council is now considering doling out &#xA0;a beer license to Taco Mamacita</a> who can&#x2019;t even serve up a proper Dirty Sanchez without swapping out the PBR for high-octane beer. Taco Mamacita has been unable to get their beer license because they&#x2019;re situated within 100 feet of a residential area. The rule does not apply to liquor licenses.</li>\n<li><strong>Custodians fight back. </strong>Some Nashville clergy and custodians who would be affected by Metro Schools&#x2019; layoffs will be <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/custodians-clergy-hold-prayer-vigil-outside-schools-budget-hearing?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">holding a vigil outside of Mayor Dean&#x2019;s meeting tonight to discuss budget cuts</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
