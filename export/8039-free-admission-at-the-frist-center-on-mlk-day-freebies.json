This drizzly, dreary weather may keep us inside on our day off, but at least we&#x2019;ll be getting cultured instead of sitting on the couch watching Netflix all day. (Who are we kidding, we&#x2019;ll be doing that too.)</p><p>We&#x2019;ve been itching to check out the <a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/calendar-exhibitions\" target=\"_blank\">current exhibits at the Frist</a>, including Tracey Snelling&#x2019;s &#x201C;Woman on the Run&#x201D; and &#x201C;A Divine Light, a collection of Northern Renaissance paintings. Today&#x2019;s the day! The Frist is open until 5:30pm on Mondays.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/eandjsfilmcrew/6388770137/\" target=\"_blank\">EAndJsFilmCrew</a>.</em></p>"}
