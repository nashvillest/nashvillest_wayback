We hadn&#x2019;t realized how expensive movie food had gotten until we accidentally shelled out $11.50 for some nachos and a small drink the other day. We would usually just abstain from movie food, but for a buck, a giant tub of greasy popcorn couldn&#x2019;t hurt! <em>via </em><a href=\"http://consumerist.com/5165002/1-popcorn-and-drinks-on-stimulus-night-at-movie-theater-chain\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/consumerist.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Consumerist</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n<p>And in even better news, we&#x2019;ve finally got ourselves a discount movie theater! Carmike is converting its Hickory Hollow 8 (yeah, Hickory Hollow is gross, we know) location to a $1.50 movie theater, and we couldn&#x2019;t be more excited. But we hope you weren&#x2019;t too attached to their Madison and Antioch locations, because they&#x2019;ve been put up for sale. Bye bye, $9 movies and $11.50 snacks! For the grand total of $3.50, we can catch a flick, fill up our bellies on chemicals (on Tuesdays, at least), and dodge some bullets! <em>via <a href=\"http://tennessean.com/article/20090311/BUSINESS01/903110396/-1/NLETTER03?source=nletter-news\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">The Tennessean</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Will new discount prices get you to the movies more often?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carmike.com/showtime.aspx\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/carmike.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Find your Carmike location here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/davefancher/2425750535/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dave Fancher</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/02/schools-out-free-summer-movies-for-kids/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids\">School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/30/hickory-hollow-mall-an-endangered-species-mixed-reviews-by-people-who-dont-live-here/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Hickory Hollow Mall: An Endangered Species [Mixed Reviews By People Who Don\" t=\"\" live=\"\" here]'=\"\">Hickory Hollow Mall: An Endangered Species [Mixed Reviews By People Who Don&apos;t Live Here]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/18/recession-roundup-nashvillest-guide-to-recession-deals-around-town/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Recession Roundup: Nashvillest Guide To Recession Deals Around Town\">Recession Roundup: Nashvillest Guide To Recession Deals Around Town</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/21/wednesday-fall-2009-nashville-originals-discount-gift-certificate-sale/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Wednesday: Fall 2009 Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificate Sale\">Wednesday: Fall 2009 Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificate Sale</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
