No drunk birds in the news this morning, but State Rep. Karen Camper (D-Memphis) did just file a bill pushing to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9934519\" target=\"_blank\">get state regulation of vasectomies on the ballot</a>. Best we can tell, the bill is basically a snarky response to all the talk about the state regulation of abortions. According to WTVF, Camper says, <span>&#x201C;I think men need to have a healthy discussion about how women are feeling about  their rights to have a vasectomy when they want to have one, and cutting off  bloodlines, and things like that.&#x201D; Points for creativity, right?<br>\n</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Snip &amp; save. </strong>The state is trying to find <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090302/NEWS03/90302056/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">creative ways to cut costs like reducing the prison population</a> by taking a better look at low-risk offenders who may be able to be released into community supervision programs. Instead of the usual $60 per day that it costs to house a criminal in Tennessee, they say this option would only cost $5 per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Party like it&#x2019;s 2009.</strong> And in case you need something to be angry about this morning, an audit <a href=\"http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/mar/02/tva-employees-charge-75m-expense-cards/\" target=\"_blank\">busted several TVA employees for charging things like Xboxes, televisions, and booze</a> to company credit cards. Actually, over $6 million in &#x201C;expenses&#x201D; had been spread out on six cards over two years.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Straight from the rumor mill: Vince Young may be <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/03/dept_of_rumormongering_titans.php\" target=\"_blank\">getting dumped via txt msg</a> &#x2026; Add <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090303/NEWS04/903030358/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">&#x2018;450 jobs&#x2019;</a> to the list of things that MTSU might be giving up to stay in business &#x2026; Meanwhile, Nashville is vying for the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090303/NEWS0202/903030348/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">2015 NHL All-Star Game</a>, which will obviously be held in Belmont&#x2019;s Curb Event Center &#x2026; Spring Hill&#x2019;s GM plant is <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9932921\" target=\"_blank\">shutting down production and kicking out all of its employees</a> <em>again</em>, but only for a little while.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pr9000/3320202967/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">pr9000</a>.</em></p>"
