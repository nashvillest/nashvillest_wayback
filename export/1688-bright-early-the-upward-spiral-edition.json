In the latest effort to put an end to some of the shadiness in Metro Nashville Public Schools, Belmont is teaming up with the school system to give Masters-level students <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090406/NEWS04/904060330/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">the chance to earn their degree while teaching in MNPS classrooms as part of the Nashville Teaching Fellows program</a>. Of course, <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=67350\" target=\"_blank\">we expect (we hope) they&#x2019;ll need to undergo an extensive background check</a> in order to do so, but hey we&#x2019;re all about bringing some change to Metro. Along with probably trimming down the payroll, the program aims to phase out some of the teaching faculty that apparently isn&#x2019;t working out so well in favor of some fresh perspectives. And because not a whole lot of folks want to jump aboard a sinking ship, if you know what we mean.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It&#x2019;s the little things. </strong>The Metro Council is <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=67344\" target=\"_blank\">still trying to figure out how to fund our fancy new conference center</a> that&#x2019;s going up near the Country Music Hall of Fame. And in case you&#x2019;ve forgotten what it looks like when you try to design a building incorporating the Parthenon, the rolling hills of Tennessee, the curves of a guitar, and instrument strings, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/30/bright-early-getting-creative-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">here you go</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Root, root, root for the home team. </strong>The Preds <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090407/SPORTS02/904070361/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">might actually meet their revenue goals after the home finale tonight against Chicago</a>, meaning they will receive the NHL&#x2019;s full revenue-sharing package. We&#x2019;re not really sure what this means, but if it helps us keep our hockey team, then we&#x2019;re all about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Please don&#x2019;t ever get drunk and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10141581\" target=\"_blank\">ram your car through a day care fence</a>, or anything for that matter &#x2026;&#xA0; The Tennessean <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090407/NEWS01/904070351/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">tries to make us feel better</a> about our economic woes &#x2026; The bill requiring driver&#x2019;s license tests to <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/3ab59ba0-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">only be given in English</a> passed in the House yesterday &#x2026; The FBI released a <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10140269\" target=\"_blank\">scary map of highway serial killings</a> including a couple of cases in Tennessee.<strong><br>\n</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rumielf/3420374020/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">rumielf</a>.</em></p>"
