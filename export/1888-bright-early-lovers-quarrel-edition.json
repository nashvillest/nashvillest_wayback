It&#x2019;s been a long time (though probably not long enough) since we&#x2019;ve heard about Nashville&#x2019;s favorite celeb John Rich doing something ridiculous, but yesterday he finally turned himself in to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090529/TUNEIN/90529004/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">face some assault and harassment charges filed against him by former <em>Nashville Star</em> contestant Jared Ashley</a>. Ashley has been claiming for a while now that Rich hit him in the face and Rich once tried to sue Ashley for defamation. We&#x2019;d give our commentary, but we doubt this story needs it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nashville for all. </strong>The Loews Vanderbilt Hotel has <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/05/loews_pulls_plug_on_islamophob.php\" target=\"_blank\">put the kibbosh on what many folks were calling an Islamophobic conference</a> that was supposed to be held there this weekend. The conference, &#x201C;Understanding the Jihad in Israel, Europe, and America,&#x201D; was organized by the New English Review and <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/05/worlds_most_respected_islamoph.php\" target=\"_blank\">featured speakers from a variety of anti-Muslim groups, websites, and publications</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>All dried up.</strong> We&#x2019;d really almost forgotten about all the water shortages last summer that left several counties dry and mooching off of neighboring counties for weeks. Sumner County, which was hit particularly hard last year, is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10441984\" target=\"_blank\">taking every possible step to be more prepared for it this time around</a>&#x2026; though we&#x2019;re certainly not seeing any shortage of rain at the moment.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Last night&#x2019;s public meeting about the proposed May Town Center <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/more-may-town-sparring-planning-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">sounds like it got a bit dramatic</a> &#x2026; The state really wants to <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/health/19593168/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">keep all of our health information in a giant database</a> to help them identify and predict Tennessee&#x2019;s health trends &#x2026; Murfreesboro is getting an early start on the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/19595874/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">mosquito prevention</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/buddhakiwi/2812737434/\" target=\"_blank\">budhakiwi</a>.</em></p>"
