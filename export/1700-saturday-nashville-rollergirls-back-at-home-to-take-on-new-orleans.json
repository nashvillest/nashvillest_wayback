On Saturday, the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillerollergirls.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Rollergirls All Stars</a> have their next home bout against the Big Easy Rollergirls of New Orleans. Our ladies tasted some sweet, sweet victory at their last sold-out home bout against the Tampa Tantrums, and we&#x2019;re more than ready to watch them claim another victory. The bout is at 7pm (doors at 6pm) at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds Sports Arena, and <a href=\"http://www.brownpapertickets.com/producerevent/52453?prod_id=3430\" target=\"_blank\">tickets</a> are $10 in advance or $15 at the door.</p>"
