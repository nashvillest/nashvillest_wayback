Stacey Campfield, set the internet rumor mill on fire last week when he posted about an alleged reception for Tennessee lawmakers at <em>Deja Vu Showgirls</em> strip club downtown. The story is that the Tennessee Cabaret Association&#x2019;s lobbyist Tracy O&#x2019;Neill (who also lobbies within the Metro Nashville government) was handing out invitations for the party at Legislative Plaza, which sported the tagline &#x201C;Party Like a Rockstar, Rock it Like a Pornstar&#x201D; and promised lots of nude girls, free drinks, and $10 lap dances. After leaving invitations with &#x201C;friends and colleagues&#x201D; including a couple of legislators, she insisted that the Cabaret Association has nothing to do with the event and it isn&#x2019;t a legislative reception, which would be a violation of Tennessee law. We&#x2019;re sort of not buying it.</p><p>Rep. Campfield got wind of the get-together and announced on his blog that he wasn&#x2019;t invited. <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2008/05/15/drop-it-like-its-hot-strip-club-invitations-on-capitol-hill-spark-controversy/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;politics.nashvillepost.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Kleinheider has the rest of the story</a> at the <em>Nashville Post,</em> and conveniently snagged a scan of the actual invite. Anyway, the controversial bash happened Friday night, and we&#x2019;re still waiting to hear who showed up.</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/25/bright-not-so-early-just-another-day-on-the-hill-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; (Not So) Early: Just Another Day On The Hill Edition\">Bright &amp; (Not So) Early: Just Another Day On The Hill Edition</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
