Here&#x2019;s a rundown of the shakeup across the river:</p>\n<p>In addition to the opening of <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/21/nashville-newcomers-nuvo-burrito/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nuvo Burrito</strong></a> in Five Points, a tiny new Vietnamese restaurant has quietly opened its doors up a couple blocks on Fatherland. <strong>Far East</strong> (get it?!) <strong>Vietnamese</strong> not only gets points for one of the most clever restaurant names we&#x2019;ve ever heard, but for bringing Vietnamese to the east-of-Charlotte masses in need of some piping hot pho. <em>Bites</em> visited Far East and <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/bites/2009/07/first_bite_far_east_vietnamese.php\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/blogs.nashvillescene.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">reported back with a thumbs-up</a>, but we&#x2019;ve heard mixed reviews from the community.</p>\n<p>Then there&#x2019;s <strong>The Green Wagon</strong>, the tiny, earth-friendly general store in Sylvan Park, who&#xA0;<a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/27/the-green-wagon-gets-second-home-in-east-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">announced an East Nashville expansion earlier this year</a>. The ink is fresh on their lease at 1100 Forrest Avenue in Five Points, and they&#x2019;re aiming to be open by September 1st. Plans for the East Nashville store include a small vegetarian cafe.</p>\n<p><strong>Las Maracas</strong> is getting two new homes in the East Nashville area. Currently, the bustling orange building in Inglewood is one of the only Mexican options on the east side (Thanks to Paul for the correction!), but that will soon change. Las Maracas is opening a true East Nashville location at 2704 Gallatin Pike in a week or two, and a Madison restaurant will follow for those a bit further down Gallatin.<br>\n<strong>UPDATE 8/4</strong>:<em>The Inglewood store will not renew its lease on October 31 of this year. We apologize for the misinformation that was passed to us by Las Maracas management.</em></p>\n<p>And we can&#x2019;t forget about <strong>PadThai Kitchen</strong>, and their&#xA0;<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/East-Nashville/browse_thread/thread/6d1244f3d9d2b04f\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/groups.google.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming move</a> from Woodland (thanks, Chris!) to a new location at 604 Gallatin Avenue in September. With the location change, they plan to be open 7 days a week, good news for east side Thai enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>All in all, we&#x2019;re kind of jealous of our East Nashville friends and their new eateries, but we can make do with frequent visits.</p>\n<p><strong>East Nashvillians, tell us</strong> &#x2013; With all your new options, what&#x2019;s one new restaurant or business that you&#x2019;d really like to see come to your part of town?</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/27/the-green-wagon-gets-second-home-in-east-nashville/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Green Wagon Gets Second Home In East Nashville\">The Green Wagon Gets Second Home In East Nashville</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/05/how-now-the-wild-cow-veggie-eats-return-to-east-nashville-newcomers/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: How Now, The Wild Cow?
