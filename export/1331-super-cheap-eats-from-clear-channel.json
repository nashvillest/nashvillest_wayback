With Christmas around the corner, we&#x2019;re a little disappointed we didn&#x2019;t find out about it sooner &#x2013; But there&#x2019;s still a few weeks to grab some gifts. And after Christmas, we&#x2019;ll grab them for ourselves!&#xA0;</p><p>So check it out. The Big 98&#x2019;s Gerry House has a site: <a href=\"http://www.gerryshalfoff.com/cc-common/ddindex2.php\" target=\"_blank\">GerrysHalfOff.com</a>. On his site, he sells half price gift certificates to local businesses. They go on sale at 8am every Friday, and today&#x2019;s biggest deals have already sold out (sorry) but as of this posting, there are still a handful of <a href=\"http://wildhorsesaloon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wildhorse Saloon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cookiesbydesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cookies By Design</a> deals left.&#xA0;</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.riverrewards.com/cc-common/ddindex2.php\" target=\"_blank\">RiverRewards.com</a>, where 107.5 The River&#x2019;s Woody &amp; Jim post their own set of deals in the exact same format. They still have a bunch of half price gift certificates left today, including some to <a href=\"http://maggiemoos.com/home/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Maggie Moos</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mcfaddensnashville.com/\" target=\"_blank\">McFadden&#x2019;s</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oasiswellnesstn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Oasis Wellness</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>And then&#x2026; there&#x2019;s more. For some reason, having two sites for two stations wasn&#x2019;t enough, and Clear Channel came up with <a href=\"http://www.nashvillegreatdeals.com/cc-common/ddindex2.php\" target=\"_blank\">NashvilleGreatDeals.com</a>, which doesn&#x2019;t appear to have any current deals and also doesn&#x2019;t appear to have been updated since early this year. Deal-hunters may want to bookmark it, just in case they get their act together. Meanwhile, the other two sites are updated with new deals every Friday at 8am, which is pretty sweet if you ask us. We&#x2019;re off to snag ourselves the last of the Maggie Moos gift certificates now, before you guys can get to them!&#xA0;</p>"}
