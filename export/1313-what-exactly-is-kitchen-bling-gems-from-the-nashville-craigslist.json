 "contentEncoded": "<p>Make your Cyber Monday even cheaper by shopping the &#x201C;free&#x201D; section on Craigslist. Who needs money when you can find deals like this?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"Ice cream scoop (Nashville)\" target=\"_blank\">Ice cream scoop (Nashville)</a></h3>\n<p>This is what you&#x2019;ve been looking for!</p>\n<p>I bought a bunch of ice cream and realized I didn&#x2019;t have an ice cream scoop. So I went to the store and bought one. Then I forgot I bought it, and bought a new, pimped-out ice cream scoop. I never got to use the first one, so it&#x2019;s sitting lonely, its virgin metal having never touched the goodness that is my favorite frozen delectable, cookies and cream ice cream.</p>\n<p>Please put this needy ice cream scoop to work. If you don&#x2019;t need an ice cream scoop, I&#x2019;m sure you could probably wield this thing in a fight, but be sure to wash the blood of your foes off of it before serving ice cream to the masses who come to cheer your victory.</p>\n<p>If fighting isn&#x2019;t your thing, the scoop has a loop on it, so you could even put it on a chain and have some kitchen-bling around your neck. If you&#x2019;re really adventurous, you could even hang it as an ear ring pendant.</p>\n<p>So take this fine piece of surplus kitchen hardware off of my hands and put it to good use. I won&#x2019;t ask any questions what you do with it!</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/16/oops-short-sweet-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Oops: Short &amp; Sweet [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Oops: Short &amp; Sweet [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/27/halloween-ideas-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Halloween Ideas [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Halloween Ideas [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/02/truck-comes-complete-with-two-strips-of-rawhide-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Truck Comes Complete With Two Strips Of Rawhide [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Truck Comes Complete With Two Strips Of Rawhide [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/16/very-ugly-painting-for-sale-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Very Ugly Painting For Sale [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Very Ugly Painting For Sale [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/01/dont-be-fooled-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Be Fooled [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Don&#x2019;t Be Fooled [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
