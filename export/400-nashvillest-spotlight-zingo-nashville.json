A driver service that picks you up on a collapsible scooter so you and your car make it home safely? Brilliant. We just can&#x2019;t understand why someone hadn&#x2019;t thought of this sooner. Better still, Zingo seems to have a sense of humor. Straight from their FAQs:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Can you drive my car home without me in it?</strong><br>\nYes.&#xC2;&#xA0; In fact, we provide this service to our regulars quite often.&#xC2;&#xA0; Our drivers can perform special tasks for you as well, such as feeding your pets if you are not going to make it home.&#xC2;&#xA0; Really.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We love it. So the next time you find yourself in a situation where you can&#x2019;t exactly get behind the wheel, give Nashville newcomers Zingo a call and wait for your personal scooter to arrive.</p>"
