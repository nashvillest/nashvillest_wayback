Regular price admission is $17 for adults, so take advantage of this rare free day. Fill up the car and take a (short) roadtrip out to The Hermitage, where you&#x2019;ll observe a traditional wreath-laying ceremony and participate in the annual &#x201C;Eighth of January&#x201D; events.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re stuck at work (like us) on Friday, you can still visit The Hermitage this month (or next, for that matter) for half price &#x2013; Just bring along a canned food donation and your Tennessee driver&#x2019;s license. A half price ticket is still $8.50, and you won&#x2019;t get to see any wreath-laying, but beggars can&#x2019;t be choosers!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanherdehaage/455967005/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>vanherdehaage</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
