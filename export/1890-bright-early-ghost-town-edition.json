After a long weekend of waiting, the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/automotive/19621128/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">2,500 employees at the Spring Hill GM plant were told this morning that the plant will be halting production indefinitely</a> as a part of the company&#x2019;s restructuring. GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this morning, and although that probably doesn&#x2019;t come as much of a shock to anyone, we&#x2019;re having a tough time imagining how much losing that many jobs will affect that community. Not the best way to kick off the week, eh?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Really? </strong>In the neverending saga of the TVA and its toxic ash, all the controversy of the past few months has caused folks to question <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090531/GREEN02/905310365/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">whether the recycled ash that has been donated to schools and parks is actually leeching arsenic</a> and all sorts of fun chemicals into the ground.</li>\n<li><strong>&#x2018;Tis the season. </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090531/NEWS01/90531032/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Summer of Smog is officially underway with the season&#x2019;s first Air Quality Alert</a>: &#x201C;Temperatures are expected to soar toward 90 and the sun beats down on the city,  creating a haze of exhaust fumes and chemicals that can be unhealthy for people  with asthma, lung disease and heart problems, as well as children and the  elderly.&#x201D;</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The new(ish) <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090530/NEWS01/905300334/-1/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">paid parking lot behind Pancake Pantry</a> is making everyone angry, so please remember that the parking people are generous folks &#x2026; Nashville has a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090530/GREEN02/905300330/-1/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">brand new Smart Car store</a> that opens today &#x2026; Governor Phil is having an <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10450579\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;emotional and exhausting&#x201D;</a> time making all of the budget cuts &#x2026; Unless biting into metal is your thing, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090531/NEWS01/905310358/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">watch out for the recalled ground beef</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/j_hunter/3162742344/\" target=\"_blank\">Justyn with a Y!</a>.</em></p>"
