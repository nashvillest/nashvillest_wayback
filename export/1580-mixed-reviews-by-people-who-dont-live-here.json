They&#x2019;ve been sitting around in our inboxes, but now it&#x2019;s time to dust them off and give them a good airing. Without further ado, the honors of the past month or so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nashville is Business Week&#x2019;s <strong><a href=\"http://realestate.msn.com/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=18184152&amp;GT1=35000#9\" target=\"_blank\">8th Unhappiest City</a></strong>. Cities were ranked based on depression rates, suicide rates, divorce rates, crime, population loss, job loss, weather and green space. Our astronomical unemployment rate also had a lot to do with our overall ranking. <em>Thanks to Michele for the tip!</em></li>\n<li>Nashville is in US News &amp; World Report&#x2019;s <strong><a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/listings/retirement/tennessee/nashville-davidson?s_cid=msnm:12retire\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 Cities To Retire</a></strong> (or <a href=\"http://realestate.msn.com/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=16837157#9\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Top 10 Tax Havens For Retirees</strong></a>, if you ask MSN). <em>Thanks to Kaitron for the tip!</em></li>\n<li>Tennessee is the state with the <a href=\"http://topnews.us/content/22812-smoking-rates-us-nosedive-all-one-state\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>6th Highest Average Annual Smoking Deaths</strong></a>. Which may have something to do with&#x2026;</li>\n<li>&#x2026;Chattanooga, Memphis and Knoxville all making the <strong>Top 10 Asthma Capitals</strong> list this year, at 4th, 6th and 7th places respectively (way to go Nashville for NOT making that one). Both via <a href=\"http://nashvilleblotter.blogspot.com/2009/01/top-asthma-capitals-for-2009.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Blotter</a>.</li>\n<li>Our alma mater, Belmont University, was ranked BusinessWeek&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/03/02/daily4.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>84th Best Undergraduate B-School</strong></a>. We&#x2019;re not sure if that&#x2019;s a backhanded compliment, but we moved up from 89th last year, and at least we made the top 100, right?</li>\n<li>And last (but certainly not least), it wouldn&#x2019;t be a Mixed Reviews post without some dismal news about our unemployment rate. For 2008, we were tied with Kentucky and Oregon for <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/srgune.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>9th Highest Unemployment Rate</strong></a> in the country. Yay?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/mattcarman/1350943635/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Carman</a>. </em></p>"
