Once upon a time, the Nashville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau held a contest you may remember called the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/18/musical-diversity-thats-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Flip Side of Nashville</a> which was intended to showcase the many different kinds of music that come out of Nashville besides country. The instructions were simple: Make a video &#x201C;expressing the alternative side of Nashville&#x2019;s music scene&#x201D; and submit to Youtube. Unfortunately, the number and quality of entries didn&#x2019;t quite meet the expectations of the bureau, as they were offering over 1,000 prizes and only 8 videos were in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/group/FlipSideNashville\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.youtube.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube group</a> by the original deadline. Extending the deadline helped a little, but not enough to salvage it from being a pretty massive flop (which still gave us some <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/22/win-win-win-nashville-loves-contests/\" target=\"_blank\">wonderful gems</a>). Oh, and did we mention the part where the Grand Prize was a round-trip to Nashville? For a contest in Nashville? So there was that.</p>\n<p>Well, they pulled a <a href=\"http://www.visitmusiccity.com/flipsideofnashville/details\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.visitmusiccity.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">winner</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/group/flipsidenashville\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.youtube.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">final pool of 15 videos</a>, may or may not have actually doled out the prize, and we didn&#x2019;t hear much more about it. Until now. We&#x2019;ve gotten wind that the bureau has produced a video of its own to use, which we&#x2019;re guessing is what they were trying to avoid by delegating it to the rest of us with the contest. It&#x2019;s really long, chock full of some beautiful aerial shots of the city, features a pretty special song by the Gabe Dixon Band, and already debuted on GAC over the weekend. So without further ado, we bring you &#x201C;Music City Calls Us Home.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Jeff G. for the tip!</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/22/win-win-win-nashville-loves-contests/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Win, Win, Win: Nashville Loves Contests\">Win, Win, Win: Nashville Loves Contests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/18/musical-diversity-thats-us/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Musical Diversity, That&#x2019;s Us!\">Musical Diversity, That&#x2019;s Us!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/20/friday-lols-snoog-doggs-country-video-surfaces/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Friday LOLs: Snoop Dogg&#x2019;s Country Video Surfaces\">Friday LOLs: Snoop Dogg&#x2019;s Country Video Surfaces</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/01/15/video-goodbye-governor-phil-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Video: Goodbye, Governor Phil [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Video: Goodbye, Governor Phil [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
