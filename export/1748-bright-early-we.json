In honor of Earth Day, Governor Phil will be test driving one of those newfangled zero emission electric cars by Nissan. Joining him are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10226579\" target=\"_blank\">some top officials from everyone&#x2019;s favorite earth-loving entity, the TVA</a>. We&#x2019;re pretty honored that these folks were able to take a break from <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10210736\" target=\"_blank\">dodging lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alexblackwelder.com/stories.html\" target=\"_blank\">spreading respiratory infections</a>, and slinging toxic sludge everywhere to join in on this celebration of our beautiful planet Earth. Actually, we kid. Get back to cleaning, TVA, and don&#x2019;t let the door hit you on your way out.</p><ul><li><strong>Gas problems.</strong> The state&#x2019;s natural gas providers are looking for a way to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090422/NEWS01/904220416/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">jack our rates up without all of that pesky regulatory oversight</a>. Thankfully the state attorney general seems to have our backs on this, which may or may not actually help.</li><li><strong>Belmont has a good idea. </strong>The good news on this Earth Day is that the good folks at Belmont have come up with a wonderful way to reduce campus waste&#x2013;<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090422/NEWS04/904220419/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">stop selling bottled water</a>. We&#x2019;re hearing some reports that a few students are devastated, but campus officials are inviting them to try out the BPA-free Nalgenes or aluminum bottles instead.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The proposed Music City convention center has a <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/04/music_city_centers_official_pr.php\" target=\"_blank\">fancy new video</a> &#x2026; Preds&#x2019; Steve Sullivan <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090422/SPORTS02/904220425/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">wants to stay in Nashville</a>, but wants us to pay him the zillions of dollars he deserves. Or okay, maybe we could just start with what he&#x2019;s actually worth &#x2026; Lipscomb is <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/04/21/barcamp-gets-healthy/\" target=\"_blank\">holding a HealthCamp</a>, which is sort of exactly like BarCamp but about health instead of the internets &#x2026; Our lotto scholarship money is <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/video/19249003/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">running out</a>, much like everything else in the state.</li></ul><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/peppysis/2418610303/\" target=\"_blank\">Peppysis</a>.</em></p>"}
