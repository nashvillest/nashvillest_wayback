The Walden building across the street from these neighborhood staples has already welcomed <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/23/nashville-newcomers-ugly-mugs/\" target=\"_blank\">three</a> <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/30/nashville-newcomers-fresh-blends-juice-smoothie-bar/\" target=\"_blank\">new</a> <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/24/duck-duck-who-the-silly-goose-entering-eastland-nashville-newcomers/\" target=\"_blank\">friends</a> in the past year, and they&#x2019;re about to get a fourth. <a href=\"http://www.thewildcow.com\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.thewildcow.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The Wild Cow Vegetarian Restaurant</a> will be joining the ever-growing eatery hotspot in early December at 1896 Eastland (the unit in the Walden building that borders Eastland).</p><p>The Wild Cow will serve hearty, homestyle vegetarian and vegan food in a fun, casual atmosphere. <a href=\"http://www.thewildcow.com/twc/?page_id=3\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.thewildcow.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The menu</a> may even entice some omnivores, with veg*n versions of many restaurant favorites. Everything on their menu sounds familiar &#x2013; That is, until you read the descriptions. But for those that shy away from foreign terms like &#x201C;tempeh,&#x201D; &#x201C;tofu&#x201D; and &#x201C;seitan,&#x201D; The Wild Cow even offers a bit of relief. How do &#x201C;grilled cheese,&#x201D; &#x201C;nachos&#x201D; and &#x201C;burrito&#x201D; sound? Owners John and Melanie Cochran have both been in the restaurant business for many years, and enjoy creating bold, flavorful meatless versions of popular dishes. And they&#x2019;re dabbling in the gluten-free world with this new venture,</p><p>Our first question when we heard about the new veggie eatery coming to town was this &#x2013; Why The Wild Cow, when cows certainly won&#x2019;t be on the menu? Well, we got our answer. The name symbolizes The Wild Cow&#x2019;s commitment to serving alternatives to food from factory farms, and a return to the &#x201C;wild cow&#x201D; comfortably grazing on the side of the road. Couple that with a perceived need for a more variety in meatless meals in East Nashville and a commitment to using local, organic produce and dairy (when available), and you have The Wild Cow.</p><p>We could go on and on. The menu is extensive, the prices are dirt cheap, the Sunday brunch is enticing and the grand opening is tentatively scheduled for December 1. The Wild Cow will be open Monday, Wednesday &#x2013; Saturday from 10:30am to 9:30pm, Sunday 10:30am to 2:30pm, and closed on Tuesdays. Their website is a wealth of information, so if you have any questions visit <a href=\"http://www.thewildcow.com/twc/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.thewildcow.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">TheWildCow.com</a>.
