The lack of news today leaves us with nothing else to talk about besides the weather, which is the same weather we&#x2019;ve been experiencing for about a month:<a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/06/storms-arrive/\" target=\"_blank\"> It&#x2019;s going to be blazingly hot today, and just when it gets to be unbearable, a Nashville-sized rain cloud will form directly over some kind of fun activity like Movies At The Park or a free Nashville Symphony concert, it will storm violently for however long it takes to cancel said activity, and then the sky will be filled with sunshine and rainbows before giving way to a beautiful blood-red sunset not unlike the one pictured above</a>. &#x201C;Damaging winds and very, very heavy rain&#x201D; are in the cards for us today which may be enough to wash away the pools of melted Nashvillians from the sidewalks, but probably not. Get us out of here.</p><ul><li><strong>Promises, promises.</strong> Remember when <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24011677/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">the VA hospital in Murfreesboro, along with two other VA hospitals, accidentally used tainted colonoscopy equipment and infected some people with Hepatitis and HIV</a>? Channel 4 checked back in with them this week and they said that although they learned a lot, they can&#x2019;t really promise it wouldn&#x2019;t happen again. Yikes!</li><li><strong>Home is where the residency is.</strong> Metro Councilman Rip Ryman <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/councilman-wants-department-heads-live-county?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">filed an ordinance that would require all Metro department heads to actually live in Davidson County</a>, which is apparently becoming quite a problem.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The <em>Tennessean</em> put together a <a href=\"http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/06/23/vince-gill-weathers-month-of-extremes-big-sorrows-and-unreal-joys/\" target=\"_blank\">very nice little retrospective on Vince Gill through the years</a> (we told you it was a slow news day) &#x2026; Nashville is <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24011955/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">stretching out the Fourth of July party as long as possible</a>, spanning the whole weekend from Friday-Sunday &#x2026; Metro Police<a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12700003\" target=\"_blank\"> accidentally took down an Ethiopian immigrant instead of the dangerous fugitive</a> they were really looking for because, well, both of them had dreadlocks.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wjb13/4714323865/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wjb13</em></a><em>.</em></p>"}
