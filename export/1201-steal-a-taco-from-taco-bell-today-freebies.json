We can thank this year&#x2019;s World Series teams for stealing a handful of bases this year, but couldn&#x2019;t we at least get a free taco for every base stolen? Don&#x2019;t be so stingy with the crunchy beef, Taco Bell. Anyway, enjoy your free tacos (an astonishing $0.89 value) this afternoon.&#xA0;</p>"
