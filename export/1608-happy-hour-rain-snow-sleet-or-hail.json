[<a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/3eb3baec-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">WZTV</a>]</li>\n<li>In case you haven&#x2019;t heard, Jack White is forming a new band called The Dead Weather and opening an office here in Nashville that&#x2019;ll be home to his new record label, vinyl store, photo studio, dark room, and performance stage. We&#x2019;re just bummed because he obvs forgot to throw in a coffee shop, swimming pool, burlesque lounge, rock climbing wall, and paint-your-own-pottery studio. (<em>Thanks to all who sent the tip!</em>) [<a href=\"http://nashville.metromix.com/music/article/jack-white-struts-some/1018089/content\" target=\"_blank\">Metromix Nashville</a>]</li>\n<li>The sicko that shot up Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist church in Knoxville last year still maintains he was doing the world a favor.

Today he was charged with two misdemeanors that might set him back, oh, $550 and six months in jail? That&#x2019;ll hurt. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18916349/detail.html#-\" target=\"_blank\">[WSMV</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/travischurch/2435877/\" target=\"_blank\">travischurch</a>.</em></p>"
