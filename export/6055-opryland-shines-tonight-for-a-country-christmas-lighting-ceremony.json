And just in the nick of time, too &#x2013; The hotel plays host to <em>A Country Christmas</em> each year, and it wouldn&#x2019;t have been quite as merry this holiday season without the lights and festivities out at Opryland.</p>\n<p>If you couldn&#x2019;t make it to the grand re-opening ceremony on Tuesday, you can still welcome Opryland back at tonight&#x2019;s lighting ceremony, where they will flip the switch on the more than 2 million lights that deck the halls of the hotel each year. And what else does the ceremony have in store?</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>CEO Colin V. Reed, Mayor Karl Dean and Opryland GM Pete Weien, will say a couple of words of thanks to the community then introduce a HUGE cast of colorful Christmas characters who will sing and dance and share their love of Christmas and light up the surroundings &#x2026; the hotel, the trees and the sky with CHRISTMAS!</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The lighting ceremony begins tonight at 6pm sharp, and guests are encouraged to arrive at 5:30 for the pre-show. Free parking will be available at Two Rivers Baptist Church, with a free shuttle running until 11pm. We&#x2019;ve heard mixed reports about the availability of free mall parking since the mall closed, so the shuttle sounds like your best bet.</p>\n<p>Also worth noting: Starting tomorrow, you can get your machine-made-snow on at Opryland. From snowball fights to igloo building to snow mazes to a reindeer display (what!),&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.gaylordhotels.com/gaylord-opryland/specials-packages/specials/country-christmas/snow-nashville.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.gaylordhotels.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Opryland is standing by to fulfill all your snowpocalypse needs</a> (for only $15). And it actually sounds sort of fun.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/denisemattox/4143559814/in/photostream/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">niseag03</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/13/tonight-25th-annual-christmas-lighting-ceremony-at-opryland/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: 25th Annual Christmas Lighting Ceremony At Opryland\">Tonight: 25th Annual Christmas Lighting Ceremony At Opryland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/17/thursday-watch-opryland-get-lit-at-annual-lighting-ceremony/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Thursday: Watch Opryland Get Lit At Annual Lighting Ceremony\">Thursday: Watch Opryland Get Lit At Annual Lighting Ceremony</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/14/meet-the-rockettes-the-radio-city-christmas-spectacular/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Meet The Rockettes: The Radio City Christmas Spectacular\">Meet The Rockettes: The Radio City Christmas Spectacular</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/04/tonight-christmas-parade-with-red-noses-john-rich-road-closures/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Christmas Parade With Red Noses &amp; John Rich [Road Closures]\">Christmas Parade With Red Noses &amp; John Rich [Road Closures]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/04/the-weekendist-its-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-christmas/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: It&#x2019;s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas\">The Weekendist: It&#x2019;s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
