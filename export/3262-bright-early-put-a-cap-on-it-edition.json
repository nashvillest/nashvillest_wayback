Anywhere from <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11533434\" target=\"_blank\">5,000 to 20,000 TennCare recipients could be affected by a spending cap that will be put into place</a> as a part of the 9% budget cut that Tennessee&#x2019;s Medicaid program will be receiving. The cap will actually be applied to more than 400,000 enrollees, but not all are expected to exceed it with their medical expenses. Children and pregnant women will be excluded from the cuts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pumpkin shortage, oh my! </strong>In addition to the devastating Eggo shortage we mentioned yesterday&#xA0;thanks to all the flooding in the ATL , <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091119/BUSINESS01/911190366/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">we&#x2019;re looking at a shortage of pumpkins&#x2013;and therefore pumpkin pie&#x2013;during the holiday season</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Convention center drama. </strong>Tower Investments, the group that owns the giant parking lot that the city is trying to buy up for the new convention center, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/21657672/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">has announced that it&#x2019;ll be suing MDHA because they feel the city is ripping them off by offering too low a price</a>. They&#x2019;ve also brought up the point that maybe Metro should hold off on buying up land until the project has actually been approved. Fair enough, right?</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
