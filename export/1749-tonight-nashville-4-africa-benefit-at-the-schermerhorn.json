But this isn&#x2019;t any ordinary benefit show, even for Nashville. This benefit will feature the likes of <strong>Keith Urban,</strong><strong> Faith Hill, Big Kenny, Dierks Bentley, Martina McBride, Jars of Clay, Third Day, Ashley Cleveland, Damien Horne, Brad Arnold (Three Doors Down), The Steeldrivers, Brandon Young, Michael Rhodes </strong>and <strong>The African Children&#x2019;s Choir</strong>.</p>\n<p>Tickets start at a pretty fair $30, and range all the way up to $200. You can <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesymphony.org/main.taf?p=1,1,6,3&amp;PerfNo=2094\" target=\"_blank\">purchase them here</a>, and it looks like the pickings are starting to get pretty slim. Still, this is one of those events that could only happen in Nashville, so grab the opportunity to see all of these artists in a beautiful venue to benefit a great cause while you can.</p>"
