Our neighbors in Cumberland County had a rough weekend after an 18-wheeler carrying some hazardous and toxic chemicals wrecked on I-40 near Crossville. Police <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8667710\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">evacuated everyone within a 2-mile radius</a>, saying that even though none of the material spilled, a chemical reaction with the rain could make things unsafe for the residents. An 80-mile stretch of I-40 was closed while Hazmat teams cleaned things up, but the coast should be clear now. Whew!</p><ul><li><strong>Boots&#x2019; trail of destruction.</strong> It&#x2019;s been a while since we heard anything about Preds minority owner William &#x201C;Boots&#x201D; Del Biaggio and all of those lawsuits we lost count of, but local Preds owners have decided to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080712/NEWS0202/807120353/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">put up the $9.8M</a> needed to keep the Preds from being in violation of their Sommet Center lease.</li><li><strong>Things we never knew.</strong> Despite the rain delays, Cindy McCain was able to make her trek around the Firestone Indy 200 on Saturday, immediately hopping out of the car and screaming, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080713/NEWS0206/807130415/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;That was great! Oh my god!&#x201D;</a> Come to find out, she and her son rebuilt a drifting car one time and did a little mother-son drifting, gaining her some serious street cred among the racing fans. And giving the rest of us something to giggle about this morning.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The elusive Green Hills coyote <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8664411\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">attacked and killed a pet dog</a> over the weekend &#x2026; We&#x2019;ve come to expect this, but it&#x2019;s still sad: <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080713/SPORTS0401/80713006/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">the Sounds lost</a>.
