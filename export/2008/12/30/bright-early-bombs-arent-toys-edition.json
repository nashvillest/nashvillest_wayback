Belmont is slated to resume its Neverending Expansion today after <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081230/NEWS04/812300331/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">an explosion for the new underground parking garage went rogue</a> on the afternoon of December 19th. This was an unfortunate day for Belmont since their graduation was also that afternoon and some of the rogue rocks happened to hit one graduate&#x2019;s parent, among some other folks. Debris from the blasting also broke a few windows in the Massey Building and took out an original 1853 glass pane in the Belmont Mansion. We&#x2019;re starting to think we were lucky to make it out of Belmont alive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Calorie counters. </strong>The Metro Board of Health has gotten an endorsement from Metro&#x2019;s Legal Department to go forward with the approval process for <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=65063\" target=\"_blank\">requiring restaurants to display calorie information</a>. They&#x2019;ll be meeting next week to review public comments and then voting on the regulation in February. If it goes through, it won&#x2019;t take effect until December 31, 2009.</li>\n<li><strong>Working the system. </strong>The Spring Hill GM plant is temporarily shut down until February 9th to save money now that car sales are down. They say it shouldn&#x2019;t affect workers too much financially since they&#x2019;re guaranteed 80% of their normal salary during the closure. The problem is that part of that 80% <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081230/BUSINESS01/812300342/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">comes from state unemployment benefits</a> which are already strained because Tennessee is broke.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The Music City Bowl usually gives our local economy a bit of a boost, but it&#x2019;s only expected to bring in <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9591283\" target=\"_blank\">half the usual revenue</a> this year &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9591702\" target=\"_blank\">Extra playoff tickets</a> went on sale this morning!
