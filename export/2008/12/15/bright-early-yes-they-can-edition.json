MTSU folks were busy this weekend <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9522941\" target=\"_blank\">protesting the Board of Regents&#x2019; bright idea to save money</a> by charging tuition by the class instead of by the semester. The students, who organized a coalition called Save Our Schools around the effort, say that what might save money for the school and the state will only make school more expensive for them. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://birmingham.bizjournals.com/birmingham/othercities/memphis/stories/2008/12/08/daily6.html\" target=\"_blank\">tuition hikes seem to be the name of the game</a> for just about every Tennessee college or university.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Natchez murder mystery. </strong>Metro Police think that they <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081212/NEWS03/81212090/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">might have found a suspect in the Natchez Trace murder</a> that happened last week. The individual was picked up for unrelated charges and tentatively linked to the crime. Police still haven&#x2019;t released the identity of the man whose body was found along the parkway because they&#x2019;re still not sure who he was.</li>\n<li><strong>The Jonas Brethren unplugged. </strong>Finally, the show we&#x2019;ve all been waiting for: <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081214/ENTERTAINMENT01/812140391/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">The Jonas Brothers are playing an acoustic-ish show at the Ryman</a> on January 4th because they wanted to do something special for their Nashville fans. They&#x2019;re planning on bringing along some special guests whose names (we&#x2019;re guessing) will probably begin with &#x201C;Miley&#x201D; and end with &#x201C;Cyrus.&#x201D; Excited yet!? Tickets will only set you back $75.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Mt. Juliet celebrated the opening of its <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9517603\" target=\"_blank\">first animal shelter</a> this weekend &#x2026; Bud Adams is pretty sure that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081214/SPORTS01/812140335/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Vince Young will reign again</a> &#x2026; An <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/weather/18277041/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news#-\" target=\"_blank\">ice storm</a> might be in the cards for us tonight &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18275163/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news#-\" target=\"_blank\">Diversity</a> is spreading in Nashville&#x2019;s suburbs &#x2026; Okay, this time we&#x2019;re not kidding: There actually is a <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9520922\" target=\"_blank\">new Cool Springs exit sign</a> up over I-65S &#x2026; Metro Schools&#x2019; central office is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9521017\" target=\"_blank\">stepping up security</a> for reasons unknown to us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/silenus81/3104142140/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">silenus81</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
