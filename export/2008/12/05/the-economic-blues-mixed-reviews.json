And, we hate to say, they’re mostly bad, with a little bit of cheery news (for Murfreesboro, at least) mixed in there. Ah, such is life.  Murfreesboro came in as the 5th Best Place To Raise A Family from BusinessWeek, beating out 635 other qualifying cities. Bravo for the ‘Boro!

And, we hate to say, they&#x2019;re mostly bad, with a little bit of cheery news (for Murfreesboro, at least) mixed in there. Ah, such is life.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Murfreesboro came in as the 5<a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9339455\" target=\"_blank\">th Best Place To Raise A Family</a> from BusinessWeek, beating out 635 other qualifying cities. Bravo for the &#x2018;Boro! Maybe Nashville didn&#x2019;t make the cut because of&#xA0;our crime rate, since we rank&#xA0;<a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2008/11/24/nashvilles-crime-rank/\" target=\"_blank\">53rd out of all U.S. metropolitan areas</a>. The good news there is that Knoxville and Memphis are more dangerous than we are (but the &#x2018;Noog is not). We&#x2019;re also now the <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9459057\" target=\"_blank\">4th Most Unhealthy State Ever</a>. Or something. Last year we were the 5th Most Unhealthy State Ever, but we are, uh, moving on up.&#xA0;And lastly, in addition to our unhealthy and crime-related woes, Tennessee ranks <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/12/01/daily21.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">14th for signs of economic distress</a>, which they figured out by noticing that we&#x2019;re 20th in the nation for foreclosures, we have the 10th highest unemployment rate, and we had the 30th largest growth in food stamp program participants. Pleasant news, isn&#x2019;t it?</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/swamysk/360173450/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>swamysk</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>"
