Bonnaroo&#x2013;that outrageous music festival in Manchester, TN that we still sort of claim as our own&#x2013;will be putting a limited number of presale tickets online tomorrow. The price tag this year is $209.50 with VIP couples tickets going for $1349.50 (and yes, they&#x2019;re <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081203/TUNEIN/81202015/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">offering a payment plan</a>!). The presale only runs through December 31st or until the tickets run out, but here&#x2019;s the catch: We still don&#x2019;t know who&#x2019;s playing. If you&#x2019;re willing to take your chances, head over to <a href=\"http://www.bonnaroo.com/tickets/ticket-info.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Bonnaroo.com</a> and pick them up tomorrow.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/joshunter/640551128/\" target=\"_blank\">joshunter</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/11/17/bonnaroo-turns-10-2011-fest-to-be-held-june-9-12-black-friday-ticket-presale/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bonnaroo Turns 10: 2011 Fest To Be Held June 9-12, Black Friday Ticket Presale\">Bonnaroo Turns 10: 2011 Fest To Be Held June 9-12, Black Friday Ticket Presale</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/19/bonnaroo-2010-presale-itll-be-here-before-you-know-it/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bonnaroo 2010 Presale: It&#x2019;ll Be Here Before You Know It\">Bonnaroo 2010 Presale: It&#x2019;ll Be Here Before You Know It</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/02/09/will-you-roo-bonnaroo-2010-lineup-tickets-available-today/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Will You &#x2018;Roo?
