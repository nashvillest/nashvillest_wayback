Something about rising fuel costs and &#x201C;the lingering effects of the drought.&#x201D; [<a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16339458/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">WSMV</a>]</li>\n<li>Rep. Rob Briley (D-Nashville) finished up his stint with the Tennessee House of Representatives today, taking a few final stabs at the press (read: bloggers) who had a lot to say about his high-speed chase/meltdown last year.
