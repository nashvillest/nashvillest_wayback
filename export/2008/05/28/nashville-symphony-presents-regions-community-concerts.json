Most of them are free, a handful cost $5 (but still free to children and college students). The first two have passed, but one was in Shelbyville, so we&#x2019;re not too concerned about missing it (the other was part of Brentwood&#x2019;s Crockett Park Concert Series, so we hope you caught <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/20/more-than-movies-in-the-park-this-year/#more-29\" target=\"_blank\">our post</a> about that).</p>\n<p><strong>June 10, 7pm</strong>: Cumberland University in Lebanon. Rain location is the Dallas Floyd Recreation Center on campus. This one will set you back $5.</p>\n<p><strong>June 17, 7:30pm</strong>: Centennial Park. Free!</p>\n<p><strong>June 24, 7:30pm</strong>: Centennial Park. Free again!</p>\n<p><strong>June 25, 7pm</strong>: Key Park in Lafayette. Free, but with gas prices, you might want to just buy a regular priced ticket.</p>\n<p><strong>July 2, 7pm</strong>: Schermerhorn Symphony Center, Laura Turner Hall. Free (this one&#x2019;s a biggie)!</p>\n<p><strong>July 4, 7:30pm</strong>: Riverfront Park. Free and part of Nashville&#x2019;s big Independence Day celebration.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/cwage/2074190207/\" target=\"_blank\">cwage</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/11/nashville-symphonys-free-regions-community-concerts-better-late-than-never/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Symphony&#x2019;s Free Regions Community Concerts [Better Late Than Never]\">Nashville Symphony&#x2019;s Free Regions Community Concerts [Better Late Than Never]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/21/sounds-like-summer-nashville-symphony-to-host-free-community-concerts-once-again/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sounds Like Summer: Nashville Symphony To Host Free Community Concerts Once Again\">Sounds Like Summer: Nashville Symphony To Host Free Community Concerts Once Again</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/01/this-weekend-regions-free-day-of-music-at-the-nashville-symphony/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Regions Free Day Of Music At The Nashville Symphony\">This Weekend: Regions Free Day Of Music At The Nashville Symphony</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/08/music-to-our-ears-free-symphony-day-returns-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Music To Our Ears: Free Symphony Day Returns [Freebies]\">Music To Our Ears: Free Symphony Day Returns [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/21/movies-in-the-park-2010-kicks-off-june-2-with-where-the-wild-things-are/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;\">Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
