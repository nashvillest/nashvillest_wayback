We never thought we&#x2019;d see the day when the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16407082/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">Russians would be taking lessons from Tennessee</a> about anything, and especially transportation planning. But Russian diplomats are, in fact, within our borders at this very moment meeting with TDOT about how they can improve their country&#x2019;s road programs. Yesterday, they toured some of Nashville&#x2019;s biggest construction projects. We just wish they could have gotten here in time to see the unfinished version of Briley Parkway. We&#x2019;re also guessing they <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/entertainment/16405950/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\">won&#x2019;t be making a stop</a> to see <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hinotes and Low Notes.</strong> A nasty Tuesday morning <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=60491\" target=\"_blank\">bicycle accident</a> sent Nashville&#x2019;s Deputy Mayor Greg Hinote to the hospital after breaking his hip. Hinote is Mayor Dean&#x2019;s right-hand man and is expected to return to the office soon. He is also the former chief-of-staff to our own U.S. Representative Jim Cooper.</li>\n<li><strong>Free bus rides.</strong> Some employers are taking matters into their own hands to help us out with the rising cost of our commutes. Vanderbilt, Belmont, and state employees <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8387091\" target=\"_blank\">can now ride the bus for free</a>. Metro Nashville employees may not be too far behind. Vanderbilt is the biggest primary employer in the Nashville area with almost 20,000 employees.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Metro schools will be making <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080527/NEWS0401/80527103/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">a few changes</a> to the dress code next year &#x2026; 16 people <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8386616\" target=\"_blank\">were shot</a> and 3 people were stabbed over Memorial Day weekend in Nashville &#x2026; Metro <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8386143\" target=\"_blank\">decides to cut</a> advanced math and English classes for middle schoolers &#x2026; 2008 has had the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/weather/16408112/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">deadliest tornado season</a> since 1998.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brandonjames/2367176311/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">brandonjames</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/30/bright-early-big-world-out-there-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Big World Out There Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Big World Out There Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
