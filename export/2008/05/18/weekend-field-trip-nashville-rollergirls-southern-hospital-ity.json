For the uninitiated, roller derby is kind of a rough sport where two teams race around a track and try to lap each other as many times as they can. In short- plenty of limbs flying, bodies slamming, skaters careening off the track, and painful looking pile-ups. And it&#x2019;s a lot of fun to watch, as long as you stay out of the way.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-90\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/img_3878b.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-91\" style=\"border: 3px solid black; margin: 3px 8px; float: left;\" title=\"img_3878b\" src=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/img_3878b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"175\" height=\"242\"></a>Like most of the matches, last night&#x2019;s went down at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds just south of downtown. It was our first time seeing it live, and we had no idea it was such a big deal. The house was packed out, though, and there were even cheerleaders (well, NRG calls them jeerleaders) who kept the crowd pumped and put on a fun show during the two intermissions. We camped out in the bleachers, but plenty of people stood around the ring or opted for the &#x201C;suicide seats,&#x201D; which we came to realize meant you could end up with a roller girl (or three) crashing into you at any given moment. The entire thing lasted about an hour and a half, and Nashville came out on top 149-65 to break their three-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Last month, the Nashville Rollergirls became the first team in Tennessee to be accepted into the Women&#x2019;s Flat Track Derby Association (national organization that oversees the sport). They seem to have hit local celebrity status in the past few months, hosting an art show at Jackson&#x2019;s Bar &amp; Bistro on W<a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/img_3987.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-95\" style=\"border: 3px solid black; margin: 3px 8px; float: right;\" title=\"img_3987\" src=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/img_3987-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"217\"></a>ednesday night and even appearing in the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillescene.com/Stories/Special_Issues/Summer_Guide/2008/05/15/Swimsuit_Photos/index.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvillescene.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nashville Scene&#x2019;s</em> summer guide</a> that came out this week.
