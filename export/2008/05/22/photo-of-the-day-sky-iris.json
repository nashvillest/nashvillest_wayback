In case you don&#x2019;t recognize it, this ominous-looking eye in the sky is the dome from inside the Opryland Hotel. We also like his Escher-ish version of the same photo, found over <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/chuy244/2511885427/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Photo Of The Day</strong> will be a recurring feature for Nashvillest as long you keep giving us stuff to post. Don&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t worry- We&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;ll give you props. Just add them to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">the pool</a> or tag them with &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;Nashvillest&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; if you&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;re feeling lazy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/16/photo-of-the-day-nash-bridges/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: Nash Bridges\">Photo Of The Day: Nash Bridges</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/13/photo-of-the-day-in-your-face/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: In Your Face\">Photo Of The Day: In Your Face</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/21/photo-of-the-day-parthenon-or-rat-maze/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: Parthenon Or Rat Maze?\">Photo Of The Day: Parthenon Or Rat Maze?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/29/photo-of-the-day-make-shift-bridge/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: Make-Shift Bridge\">Photo Of The Day: Make-Shift Bridge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/19/photo-of-the-day-june-19-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day, June 19, 2008\">Photo Of The Day, June 19, 2008</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
