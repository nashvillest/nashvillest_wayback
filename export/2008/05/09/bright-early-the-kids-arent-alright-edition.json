The homeless weren&#x2019;t the only ones busy protesting this week. Yesterday, the kids at Franklin High School <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/video/16205680/index.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\">staged a riot of their own</a> in the school&#x2019;s gymnasium after a group of masked vandals brought a deluge of spray-painted terror down upon the hallways. The young hooligans were caught on tape by the school&#x2019;s security cameras and students were rounded up into the gym <em>Mean Girls</em>-style to talk about the problem. Thanks to those kids and their newfangled technologies, they staged a coup by text messaging each other and stormed the doors at 9:30 AM. Blurry cell phone videos were up on Youtube within hours. Our favorite is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-sWo94tqZ8\">this one</a> for the commentary and musical score. Points for creativity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Colorful Canine</strong>.
