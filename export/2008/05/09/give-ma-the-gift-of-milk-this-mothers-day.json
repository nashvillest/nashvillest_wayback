This year, word on the street is that it&#x2019;s going to be a little more memorable. Nominations are being accepted for Nashville&#x2019;s Chief Health Officer, a.k.a. good ol&#x2019; mom.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>To mom-inate a worthy mother in the Chief Health Officer Contest, record a 30-second &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;mom-ination&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; video explaining why their mom &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; or a mom they know &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; is Nashville&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Chief Health Officer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Nashville&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Chief Health Officer will then have a chance to be crowned America&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Chief Health Officer and receive the chance to appear in her very own Milk Mustache ad, a year supply of milk, a three month membership to Curves International and a year subscription to &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;Redbook&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; magazine. And as an added bonus, you can also enter into our Chief Health Officer sweepstakes, which also will reward a mom a $100,000 salary she &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;richly&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; deserves!
