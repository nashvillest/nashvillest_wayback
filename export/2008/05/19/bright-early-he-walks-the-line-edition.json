If you weren&#x2019;t in Las Vegas last night for the ACM Awards like the luckier half of the city, chances are you might have been watching them on TV. Either way, Nashvillest sends out a big &#x201C;congrats&#x201D; to <a href=\"http://www.cmt.com/acm-awards/winners.jhtml\" target=\"_blank\">all of the winners</a>, and especially to 2008 Entertainer of the Year Kenny Chesney. We saw <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8344379\" target=\"_blank\">so many familiar faces</a> during the show last night, and our Nashvillian hearts were glowing with pride the whole time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yes, we know. It&#x2019;s election year.</strong> From the department of shameless publicity stunts comes former State Democratic Party Chairman Bob Tuke&#x2019;s 15-mile walk through Nashville yesterday. If you were out at Centennial Park enjoying the nice weather, you may have run into him campaigning for Sen. Lamar Alexander&#x2019;s seat in the U.S. Senate. We&#x2019;re already experiencing campaign-overload.</li>\n<li><strong>Happy Safe Boating Week</strong>. A yacht in West Nashville <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8342195\" target=\"_blank\">caught on fire</a> over the weekend and sank at the Rock Harbor Marina. No one was on the boat at the time, but the owner had been cleaning it the night before because he planned on selling it for a half-million dollars. And it was the first day of Safe Boating Week. Ouch! We loved <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8341793\" target=\"_blank\">Channel 5&#x2032;s</a> take on the situation, which pointed out that &#x201C;[y]ou wouldn&#x2019;t hand the car keys to untrained 16 year old but some boaters have just as little preparation.&#x201D;</li>\n<li><strong>More headlines that make us go &#x201C;huh?&#x201D; </strong><a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8344308\" target=\"_blank\">Pillow accused of impersonating fireman</a>. Greg Pillow, that is. Channel 5 clearly got a kick out of it, and that&#x2019;s why we love them.<strong> </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; Pieces</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080517/GREEN04/805170310/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Urban garden</a> trend hits Nashville &#x2026; Titans want <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8339390\" target=\"_blank\">new HD monitors</a> for LP Field &#x2026; Check your <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8338157\" target=\"_blank\">$100 bills</a>.
