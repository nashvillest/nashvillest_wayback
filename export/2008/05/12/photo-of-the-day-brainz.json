Thanks to all who have submitted your shots so far. Keep it up and spread the word! This one comes to us from <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gratiot/\" target=\"_blank\">gratiot,</a> one of our first donors. We felt like it was just creepy enough to get the zombies out of our system. Happy Monday.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Photo Of The Day</strong> will be a recurring feature for Nashvillest as long you keep giving us stuff to post. Don&#x2019;t worry- We&#x2019;ll give you props. Just add them to the pool or tag them with &#x201C;Nashvillest&#x201D; if you&#x2019;re feeling lazy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/19/photo-of-the-day-june-19-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day, June 19, 2008\">Photo Of The Day, June 19, 2008</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/30/photo-of-the-day-scarritt-bennett/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: Scarritt-Bennett\">Photo Of The Day: Scarritt-Bennett</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/16/photo-of-the-day-nash-bridges/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: Nash Bridges\">Photo Of The Day: Nash Bridges</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/12/photo-of-the-day-june-12-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: June 12, 2008\">Photo Of The Day: June 12, 2008</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/23/photo-of-the-day-june-23-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: June 23, 2008\">Photo Of The Day: June 23, 2008</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
