Every Thursday when they&#x2019;re home, the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesounds.com\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Sounds</a> and the Miller Lite Concert Series host <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesounds.com/schedule/schedule.asp?scheduleId=1016\" target=\"_blank\">Thirsty Thursdays</a> at Greer Stadium. Concert starts at 6 (we&#x2019;re not sure who&#x2019;s playing), game at 7, and <strong>$1 draft beer until 8:30</strong> or the 5th inning&#x2013;whichever comes first. It might be a little wet tonight, but The Weather Channel is <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/37215?from=36hr_fcstHourLink_undeclared\" target=\"_blank\">predicting</a> the rain will have mostly moved out by this evening with a few leftover storms possible. Either way, you win- baseball, cheap beer, and plenty of good times. Hopefully the Sounds win too since we hear they&#x2019;re in <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesounds.com/stats/Default.asp?stats=l_sta\" target=\"_blank\">last place</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/brent_nashville/169208012/\" target=\"_blank\">brent_nashville</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/03/not-so-thirsty-thursdays-at-greer-stadium-in-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Not-So-Thirsty-Thursdays At Greer Stadium In 2009\">Not-So-Thirsty-Thursdays At Greer Stadium In 2009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/12/nashville-sounds-introduce-thirsty-ish-throwback-thursdays/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Sounds Introduce Thirsty-ish Throwback Thursdays\">Nashville Sounds Introduce Thirsty-ish Throwback Thursdays</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
