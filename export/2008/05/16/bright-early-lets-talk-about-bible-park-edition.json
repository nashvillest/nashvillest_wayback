This edition goes out to our Rutherford Co. readers who have our deepest sympathies because they might end up with some sort of tacky Bible theme park in their neighborhood. From what we hear, most people seem to think it&#x2019;s a bad idea including <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleistalking.com\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Is Talking</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleistalking.com/node/38390\" target=\"_blank\">colorful <span class=\"V00000011px\">expos&#xC3;&#xA9;</span></a> last week caught our attention. The planning commission met last night to vote on it and as of press time, we&#x2019;re not sure what went down. WTVF and the <em>Tennessean</em> <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080515/NEWS02/80515142/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">both packed up</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8333590\" target=\"_blank\">left</a> the meeting around 10:30pm, which is why we have nothing to report. Maybe someone can fill us in this morning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We&#x2019;re not in Kansas anymore.</strong> Channel 4 looked at 50 years&#x2019; worth of data and determined that our very own Davidson Co. is the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/weather/16276883/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">most tornado-ridden county</a> in all of Middle Tennessee, with Sumner and Rutherford coming in at a close second. Duck and cover, y&#x2019;all.</li>\n<li><strong>Speaking of tornadoes</strong>. Union University is finally rebuilding its dorms after a tornado <a href=\"http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/feb/06/devastated-union-university-wont-reopen-till-feb-1/\" target=\"_blank\">tore through</a> the campus back in February. Students have been <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8333289\" target=\"_blank\">leaving messages</a> on the concrete floor before the carpet is laid over it to remember the destruction. 51 students wound up in the hospital after the Feb. 5th twister, but none were seriously injured.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; Pieces</strong>. Nashville mom <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16278155/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">sends care packages</a> to Chinese kids who lost parents in the this week&#x2019;s earthquake &#x2026; If you ate at Jonathan&#x2019;s Grille on Nolensville last weekend, you may want to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8332633\" target=\"_blank\">check your credit card statements</a> &#x2026; Spring Hill&#x2019;s property tax might be <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8333663\" target=\"_blank\">making a comeback</a> &#x2026; Hats off to the Sounds, who <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080515/SPORTS0401/80515140/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">actually won</a> last night.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wilonstott/2366941992/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">wilonstott</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: WTVF is saying that Rutherford Co. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8334627\" target=\"_blank\">shot down Bible Park</a> 12-9, so we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Apparently the developers can reapply, but they&#x2019;d have to wait a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/happy-hour-bible-belted/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Bible Belted\">Happy Hour: Bible Belted</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/16/happy-hour-throw-your-hands-up/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Throw Your Hands Up\">Happy Hour: Throw Your Hands Up</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
