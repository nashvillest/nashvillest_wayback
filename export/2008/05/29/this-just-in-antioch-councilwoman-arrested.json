We wish we could tell you it was something scandalous or even remotely interesting, but it turns out she was just caught driving on a suspended license two weeks ago. She apparently had a few outstanding tickets she failed to pay, which is why her license was suspended, and she paid them the day after she was pulled over. Unfortunately for her, it was too little too late. Though sort of have to chuckle at the thought of a harmless-looking city official in the slammer, we&#x2019;re not sure yet how this affects her seat on the council.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
