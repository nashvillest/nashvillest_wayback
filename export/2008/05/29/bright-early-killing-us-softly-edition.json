In the latest series of bad reviews by people who don&#x2019;t live here, we&#x2019;ve been ranked the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080529%2FGREEN03%2F805290357%2F1001%2FRSS01\" target=\"_blank\">sixth worst city for carbon emissions</a> among the US&#x2019;s 100 largest cities. Memphis, Knoxville, and Chattanooga- before you start pointing fingers, you guys also made the top 25. What can we do? Mayor Dean says he&#x2019;s already on it, working with city officials to build greener buildings across the city and improve the ones we already have.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>School closures.</strong> If the Board of Education approves it, five Metro schools could be <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/16423378/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">closing their doors</a> in the 2009-2010 school year because of low enrollment. W.A. Bass, Martha Vaught, Ewing Park, Brookmeade and Cora Howe are among the five that would be affected, but the plan would likely save the city $4.5M.</li>\n<li><strong>Foiled again.</strong> We&#x2019;re really disappointed to hear that we missed the <em>Hannah Montana</em> movie <a href=\"http://musiccitytv.com/2008/05/28/if-you-see-more-paparazzi-in-town-could-be-miley/\" target=\"_blank\">filming</a> <em>again</em> in the Cool Springs Galleria yesterday, especially since Tyra Banks and Vanessa Williams were both there. WKRN reports that a photo of Miley&#x2019;s first public kiss could go for anywhere from <a href=\"http://musiccitytv.com/2008/05/28/if-you-see-more-paparazzi-in-town-could-be-miley/\" target=\"_blank\">$30K to $150K</a>, so we&#x2019;re kind of thinking of going full-time as paparazzi.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
