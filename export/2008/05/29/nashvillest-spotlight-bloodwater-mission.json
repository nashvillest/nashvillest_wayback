With the motto &#x201C;Clean blood, clean water,&#x201D;  Blood:Water is<em> &#x201C;Partnering with groups and individuals to empower Africans to build healthier communities through sustainable clean blood and clean water solutions, while developing social responsibility in the U.S. through initiatives that provoke personal engagement and ownership.&#x201D;</em> We are on board with that. They always have their hands in something, and currently that something weighs in as a little cross-country bike trip.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ridewelltour.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ride:Well Bike Tour</a> will be crossing the U.S. from Los Angeles to Washington D.C., and they start riding on June 9. The team of 17 includes 2 African students and author <a href=\"http://www.donaldmillerwords.com/ride/\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Miller</a>, of <em>Blue Like Jazz</em> fame. They&#x2019;ll be stopping in three major cities along the way to ride a shorter trip with the locals, and yes, Nashville is one of those stops. On July 12, the riders will show up in Nashville to ride a 25-mile course through the city (don&#x2019;t worry, a 12 mile course is also offered) with <a href=\"http://www.ridewelltour.com/CITYRIDES/NashvilleJuly12/tabid/1679/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">anyone who registers</a> to participate.</p>\n<p>If biking long distances isn&#x2019;t your thing, we have an alternative.
