It seems that Amazing Race-esque scavenger hunts are all the rage this year, because <a href=\"http://www.urbandare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Dare</a> is visiting us for the first time tomorrow. Started in 2005 by D.C. political consultant and adventure aficionado Kevin Keefe, Urban Dare has grown to include 19 cities this year. We&#x2019;re pleased to be among the 19, and even though Nashvillest just found out, it seems plenty of people already knew. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080530/ENTERTAINMENT07/805300330/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Over 40 teams</a> have already signed up for Saturday&#x2019;s adventure.</p>\n<p>The rules are simple on purpose: No cars or bikes. You must use your feet or public transportation to get around, you must compete as a team of 2 (who then must stay together during the race), and you must pay the $90 entry fee. Ouch. You also must hit the streets with only a cell phone and a digital camera, better if it&#x2019;s simply a camera phone. Urban Dare is &#x201C;<em>the race where smarts can beat speed.</em>&#x201D;</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;d like to register, you can do so <a href=\"http://www.active.com/page/Event_Details.htm?event_id=1516330&amp;assetId=027f61ee-acd4-4292-96e1-e8a3c362e2ff\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, or simply show up at <a href=\"http://www.urbandare.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">11am tomorrow</a> at the Music City Walk Of Fame. The race starts at 12pm, if you have other plans for your $90 this weekend (we plan to ceremoniously pour it into our <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=8399140\" target=\"_blank\">gas tank</a>) but would still like to watch. Take some pictures for our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/nashvillest/pool/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr pool</a> and let us know what you think.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/chrisafer/2425677852/\" target=\"_blank\">chrisafer</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/03/this-weekend-the-most-unfortunately-named-urban-adventure-race-ever/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: The Most Unfortunately Named &#x201C;Urban Adventure&#x201D; Race Ever\">This Weekend: The Most Unfortunately Named &#x201C;Urban Adventure&#x201D; Race Ever</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/17/urban-outfitters-grand-opening-march-26-finally/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Urban Outfitters Grand Opening March 26 (Finally)\">Urban Outfitters Grand Opening March 26 (Finally)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/04/urban-outfitters-grand-opening-to-include-will-hoge-sorta-kinda-maybe/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Urban Outfitters Grand Opening To Include Will Hoge (Sorta Kinda Maybe)?\">Urban Outfitters Grand Opening To Include Will Hoge (Sorta Kinda Maybe)?</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
