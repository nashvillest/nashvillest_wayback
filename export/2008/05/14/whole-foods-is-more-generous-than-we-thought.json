We&#x2019;re certainly no strangers to <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wholefoodsmarket.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Foods</a>, as you could say  Nashvillest &#x201C;headquarters&#x201D; is right across the street from the new Hill Center. But usually a trip to Whole Foods for us means wandering through the path most likely to guarantee new samples, while knowing that shopping at Whole Foods is the best way to blow a limited food budget in one shot. We&#x2019;re jumping for joy after discovering the wealth of free events that both the <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/calendars/GHL.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wholefoodsmarket.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Foods Market</a> in Green Hills and the <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/calendars/WLM.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wholefoodsmarket.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Wild Oats Natural Marketplace</a> in Cool Springs offer. Complimentary massages in Whole Body, free tastings with the Salud! Cooking School chefs, wine &amp; cheese pairings, shrimp demonstrations (sampling required, of course), local growers demonstrations, free vegetarian &amp; raw foods cooking classes, free beer tastings, health &amp; budget shopping classes, and a weekly kids hour are among the bounty we&#x2019;ve discovered. Wild Oats also offers several classes that range from $10-$35, but we&#x2019;re confident that they&#x2019;re worth it.</p>\n<p>Another Whole Foods tip &#x2013; If you&#x2019;ve been eyeing the <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/calendars/GHLsalud.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wholefoodsmarket.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Salud! Cooking School</a> but can&#x2019;t quite lay down the $35-$100 per class, they offer a volunteer program. You attend and help with the chopping, boiling and cleaning for 4 classes, you get a credit for a free class of your choice! That&#x2019;s 5 classes you can attend for only the cost of a little elbow grease.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/johnlamb/1661864674/in/photostream/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">johnlamb</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/19/cool-springs-wild-oats-morphs-into-whole-foods-today/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Cool Springs Wild Oats Morphs Into Whole Foods Today\">Cool Springs Wild Oats Morphs Into Whole Foods Today</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/31/this-weekend-celebrate-one-year-with-whole-foods/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Celebrate One Year With Whole Foods\">This Weekend: Celebrate One Year With Whole Foods</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/16/happy-hour-land-of-a-thousand-whole-foods/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Land Of A Thousand Whole Foods\">Happy Hour: Land Of A Thousand Whole Foods</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
