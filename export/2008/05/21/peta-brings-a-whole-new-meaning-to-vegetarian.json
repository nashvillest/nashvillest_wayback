Unfortunately, it seems that the only thing going on by way of celebration is that <a href=\"http://www.johnnyrockets.com/locations/locations.php?State=TN&amp;orders=\" target=\"_blank\">Johnny Rockets</a> &amp; PETA are offering a free veggie burger with <a href=\"http://www.vegcooking.com/johnnyrocketspecial.asp\" target=\"_blank\">lots of strings attached</a>. PETA must have realized that the gesture was a little on the stingy side, because some <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8356883\" target=\"_blank\">meat-packed, naked humans</a> appeared in the streets downtown yesterday to add a little <em>oomph</em> to our week. Happy World Vegetarian Week to you too, PETA.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;d like to hold your own observation of World Vegetarian Week, Nashvillest recommends checking out <a href=\"http://www.pmnashville.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PM&#x2019;s</a> new spring menu with a wide variety of vegan/vegetarian selections that differ from the everyday fare.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/valjk/634696442/\" target=\"_blank\">valjk</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
