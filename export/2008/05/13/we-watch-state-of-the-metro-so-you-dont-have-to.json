At any rate, the reactions around town have been mixed, but the overall consensus is the same: We&#x2019;re short on cash. Mayor Dean announced this morning that all departments would be operating with significantly smaller budgets this year with the exception of Metro Public Schools, which will <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16250119/detail.html\">receive about half</a> of the $1.58 billion budget. Why? To put it simply, things aren&#x2019;t going real well. The school system as a whole is facing the possibility of a state intervention within the next two years if they continue to fall short of meeting No Child Left Behind requirements&#x2013;something that Dean says is &#x201C;not something we want to happen.&#x201D; No kidding.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-41\"></span></p>\n<p>Between that and the 200 layoffs, it was a pretty grim address. He did try to focus on the positives, such as the $1M proposal for a new DNA crime lab for the Metro Police, Maplewood High School&#x2019;s football state championship outing, and Nashville being chosen as one of two cities for an Alternative High School pilot initiative (we&#x2019;re not really sure what that is, either.) <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2008/05/dean_ducks_tax_issue_in_state.php\" target=\"_blank\">Pith In The Wind</a> isn&#x2019;t buying it, though, saying he played up the smaller issues to skirt around the revenue shortfall.</p>\n<p>On a related note, we feel like we almost <em>have</em> to send you over to News Channel 4 to watch the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/video/16253488/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">wonderfully awkward video</a> segment on the address. Lots of awkward lulls, and also, if you&#x2019;re one of the 5,000 Nashvillians between the ages of 16 and 24 who&#x2019;s not in school, Channel 4 thinks you&#x2019;re a &#x201C;very hopeless and very dangerous&#x201D; person. But don&#x2019;t fret- Nashvillest is here for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/23/mayor-deans-long-boring-speech-explained-state-of-metro/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Mayor Dean&#x2019;s Long &amp; Boring Speech Explained [State Of Metro]\">Mayor Dean&#x2019;s Long &amp; Boring Speech Explained [State Of Metro]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/04/29/bright-early-the-state-of-things-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The State Of Things Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The State Of Things Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/02/02/happy-hour-state-of-the-state-of-the-state/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: State Of The State Of The State\">Happy Hour: State Of The State Of The State</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/31/happy-hour-gotta-watch-those-georgians/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Gotta Watch Those Georgians\">Happy Hour: Gotta Watch Those Georgians</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
