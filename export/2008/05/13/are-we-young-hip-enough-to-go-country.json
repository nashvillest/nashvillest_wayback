If you self-identify with this description, arrive at the Wildhorse at 6:30pm tomorrow, May 14, for placement along the red carpet and in the &#x201C;pit.&#x201D; Red carpet reception begins filming at 7 and the concert is at 8:30. For your troubles, you will get to witness the following laundry list of celebrities as they attempt to debut an original country song:</p>\n<p>Sebastian Bach (frontman of Skid Row), Mikalah Gordon (American Idol), Jermaine Jackson (Jackson 5), Chris Kirkpatrick (N&#x2019;SYNC), Lorenzo Lamas (Renegade &amp; Falcon Crest) and Sean Young (Blade Runner &amp; Ace Ventura Pet Detective).</p>\n<p>Chris from N&#x2019;SYNC? We won&#x2019;t pretend our inner 12 year old isn&#x2019;t leaping at this opportunity. Maybe we&#x2019;ll see you there after all.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
