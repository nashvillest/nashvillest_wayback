True to AAA&#x2019;s projection of <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/05/19/daily62.html\" target=\"_blank\">fewer holiday travelers</a>, we&#x2019;re staying local and looking for something to do. Luckily, the holiday weekend brings a plethora of interesting activities to the table. Don&#x2019;t forget why we all have the day off work, though &#x2013; Take a moment to remember those who have given their lives in service to our country.</p>\n<p><strong>Memorial Day Dash 5K Run/Walk</strong>: 8am at Greer Stadium. <a href=\"http://www.active.com/page/Event_Details.htm?event_id=1574917&amp;assetId=0e28b522-a016-481f-ad33-f681944393e6\" target=\"_blank\">Registration</a> is $25.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The Course for the 5K Run/Walk begins at Greer Stadium, loops around Ft. Negley, runs past Adventure Science Center, then finishes inside The Nashville City Cemetery. All proceeds benefit the Restoration of the Nashville City Cemetery. Awards ceremony, refreshments, and door prize giveaway following the race. A $100.00 gift certificate to be awarded to the Best Patriotic running outfit. Race Management and ChampionChip Timing provided by the <a href=\"http://nashvillestriders.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Striders</a>.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Running around a cemetery at 8am on a holiday isn&#x2019;t really our cup of tea, but we admit it &#x2013; we&#x2019;re lazy.</p>\n<p><strong>Legends Of The Blues Festival:</strong> 12pm-7pm at Centennial Park. Hosted by the <a href=\"http://www.musiccityblues.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Blues Society</a>, there&#x2019;s a day full of great free blues music planned. This is the 5th year of the annual festival, and attendance is expected to surpass 5,000 people. <a href=\"http://www.hon.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&amp;_action=load&amp;ixActivity=973&amp;PHPSESSID=136a3ce2dd5513cc...\" target=\"_blank\">Hands On Nashville</a> is looking for volunteers to help with set up, if you&#x2019;d like to help out.</p>\n<p><strong>Salute To Freedom: </strong>This one is a Sunday event, 5pm at <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleshores.com/news.php?viewStory=157\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Shores</a>. Military families get a variety of perks, from half off park tickets all weekend to a special dinner for active and retired members of the Armed Forces. Live music, hot air balloon rides, a flag-raising ceremony and fireworks will top off this free event. They&#x2019;re claiming that their fireworks display is the biggest Memorial Day fireworks display in Middle Tennessee, which would sound impressive if only we could find another fireworks display happening around town.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/jcolman/441030585/\" target=\"_blank\">jcolman</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/04/wednesday-kick-off-the-kick-off-cmapocalypse-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Wednesday: Kick Off The Kick Off (CMApocalypse 2008)\">Wednesday: Kick Off The Kick Off (CMApocalypse 2008)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/31/its-memorial-day-brb/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: It&#x2019;s Memorial Day [BRB]\">It&#x2019;s Memorial Day [BRB]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/22/the-weekendist-remember-the-days-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Remember The Days Edition\">The Weekendist: Remember The Days Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/02/the-weekendist-4th-of-july-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: 4th Of July Edition\">The Weekendist: 4th Of July Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
