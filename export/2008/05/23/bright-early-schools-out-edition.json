While the kids are enjoying their first day of summer bliss, WKRN brings us the sad story about a Dickson County high school senior who decided to go green and save gas by <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8368307\" target=\"_blank\">riding a horse to school</a> yesterday. He thought it would be &#x201C;cute&#x201D; and &#x201C;fun,&#x201D; but apparently Dickson County schools lack a sense of humor and aren&#x2019;t letting him walk at his own graduation. Adding insult to injury, his grandmother even met with the heartless principal and explained that she and her husband want to see their grandson graduate because her husband has an incurable kidney disease, but he wouldn&#x2019;t budge. Nashvillest still loves you, Caleb Anderson. Stay green.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remember the Titans</strong>. Titans quarterback Vince Young <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=60412\" target=\"_blank\">apologized</a> for some scandalous party pictures that surfaced on the internet this week. The pictures featured him <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2008/05/16/vince-young-quarterback-gone-wild/\" target=\"_blank\">shirtless and drinking</a>. We love how TMZ slapped stars over the men&#x2019;s chests in the photo just in case Vince Young chugging a bottle of hard liquor wasn&#x2019;t sketchy enough for us.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch your back</strong>. Downtown residents have seen a <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8368816\" target=\"_blank\">53% increase</a> in street robberies in the last year. Even the president of the Urban Residents Association Ben Bahil <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16262325/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">fell victim</a> last September. Metro plans on increasing their presence in the downtown area and possibly sending some plainclothes officers down there to keep an eye on things.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>. Belmont totally <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=60416\" target=\"_blank\">beat Lipscomb</a> 9-8 in the Atlantic Sun Tournament yesterday &#x2026; McDonald&#x2019;s commits to <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/health/16363976/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\">zero trans-fats</a> by the end of the year (we&#x2019;re smiling big here) &#x2026; UT <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=60407\">raises their tuition</a> by 6% and Gov. Bredesen is really happy about it &#x2026; The body of the boater who <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16323606/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">disappeared last weekend</a> has been found in Old Hickory Lake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roger_m/2133324461/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">rogerma</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/03/bright-early-save-our-schools-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Save Our Schools Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Save Our Schools Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
