We&#x2019;d like to extend a great big Nashvillest congratulations to all of you out in Murfreesboro, because the census numbers are in and you guys have officially hit <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8380413\" target=\"_blank\">100,000 residents</a>, making you the sixth city in Tennessee to hit the 100K mark. Only about 500,000 more to go before you catch up with us! We believe in you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Making history</strong>. Yes, we get it: Gas is expensive, and filling up our gas tanks causes us physical pain these days. It seems like the headlines are getting repetitive, but here&#x2019;s a new one: Americans&#x2019; driving has <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/26/gas.driving/index.html?eref=ib_topstories\" target=\"_blank\">dropped by 4.3%</a> (11 billion miles) since last March, which is the biggest drop <em>in the history of cars</em>. Nashvillest tip: <a href=\"http://www.nashvillegasprices.com/index.aspx?&amp;area=Nashville%20-%20Central&amp;area=Nashville%20-%20North&amp;area=Nashville%20-%20SE&amp;area=Nashville%20-%20South&amp;area=Nashville%20-%20SW&amp;area=Nashville%20-%20West\" target=\"_blank\">www.gasbuddy.com</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Barroom hero.</strong> Most of us here have had some less-than-kind things to say about Nashville law enforcement, but this story is worth retelling: A Davidson Co. deputy is <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16396732/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">still in intensive care</a> at Vanderbilt after being stabbed multiple times in a bar on Saturday night. The off-duty deputy came to the defense of an African-American man who was being taunted with racial slurs by another customer, who stabbed the officer several times before being tackled by others in the bar. Nashvillest has a special place in our heart for you, Deputy Harding. Get well soon.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
