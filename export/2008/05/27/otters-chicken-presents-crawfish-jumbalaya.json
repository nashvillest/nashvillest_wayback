Never fear, Cajunfest is here! In its 5th year, the Music City Cajunfest is really just a fancy name for friends, music, crawfish, jumbalaya, beer, music, and good times. And it&#x2019;s only $25 for all you can eat food and 2 beer tickets. We know a good deal when we hear one, and this is a good deal. <a href=\"http://musiccitycajunfest.eventbrite.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;musiccitycajunfest.eventbrite.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Get your tickets</a> before the 30th at this price, or it&#x2019;s $30 at the door! <em>[<a href=\"http://limelightnashville.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;limelightnashville.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Limelight</a> at 201 Woodland Street, across from LP Field. 2pm.]</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/15/this-weekend-merrell-crawfish-boil-moves-across-the-river/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Merrell Crawfish Boil Moves Across The River\">This Weekend: Merrell Crawfish Boil Moves Across The River</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/15/the-weekendist-too-many-crawfish-too-little-time-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: So Many Crawfish, So Little Time Edition\">The Weekendist: So Many Crawfish, So Little Time Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/30/hot-holidays-with-hot-chicken-music-city-hot-chicken-festival/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Hot Holidays With Hot Chicken: Music City Hot Chicken Festival\">Hot Holidays With Hot Chicken: Music City Hot Chicken Festival</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
