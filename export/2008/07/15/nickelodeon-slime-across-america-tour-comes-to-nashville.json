The <a href=\"http://www.nick.com/slime/\" target=\"_blank\">Nickelodeon Slime Across America</a> Tour, of course. The &#x201C;Slimemobile&#x201D; will be at <a href=\"http://nashville.gov/parks/pdfs/main/08jul/SlimeAcrossAmerica.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Centennial Park</a> this Saturday for some serious slime action. This is a blast from the past for us, and while it probably still won&#x2019;t be as cool as Super Sloppy Double Dare, we bet it&#x2019;ll be pretty impressive for the kids. The event runs from 12pm-5pm with a performance by Epic Records&#x2019; MTV-made boyband, Menudo, at 2pm.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
