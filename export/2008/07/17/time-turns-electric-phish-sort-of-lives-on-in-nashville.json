Trey Anastasio (yes, he&#x2019;s out of jail), better known as the frontman of Phish, has teamed up with local composer Don Hart to create an orchestral work called &#x201C;Time Turns Electric.&#x201D; And its inaugural performance on September 27 will be right here in Nashville, TN at the <a href=\"http://www.ryman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryman</a> Auditorium. Even if you&#x2019;re not a Phish fan, this is going to be a pretty memorable event.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/bouche/193162884/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>bouche</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
