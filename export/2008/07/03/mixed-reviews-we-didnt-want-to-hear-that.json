Tennessee is the 6th fattest state, <a href=\"http://consumerist.com/tag/fattest-states/?i=5021721&amp;t=the-10-fattest-states-in-the-country\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/consumerist.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">hanging onto its rank from last year</a>. And we&#x2019;ve actually gotten fatter than last year, with 30.7% of Tennesseeans qualifying as &#x201C;obese&#x201D; in 2007 and up to 31.9% claiming the title this year.

Gross, and thank heaven for Memphis and their overall rank of #5 sweatiest city in the nation. At #27, we suddenly feel better about coming in second. Our neighbors in Chattanooga came in #35 overall, and Knoxville landed #41.
