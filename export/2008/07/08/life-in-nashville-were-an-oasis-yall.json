Despite being America&#x2019;s 6th fattest city, having the nation&#x2019;s 2nd highest incarceration rate AND being Tennessee&#x2019;s 2nd sweatiest city, we do have some things going for us. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban&#x2019;s recent decision to stay in Nashville for their birth of their daughter has drawn us into the nation&#x2019;s spotlight, and our relaxed atmosphere and laid-back style of living doesn&#x2019;t escape the media. <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080709/ap_en_mu/kidman_baby_nashville\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080709/ap_en_mu/kidman_baby_nashville&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo! Entertainment</a> is speculating on our city and our celebrities, with nothing but good to say.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#x201C;I definitely think it&#x2019;s easier to live as a celebrity in Nashville,&#x201D; said Maureen O&#x2019;Connor, a publicist with Los Angeles-based Rogers &amp; Cowan. &#x201C;Most of America is an easier place to live as a celebrity. Nashville has the advantage of also being a place that you can do entertainment industry business quite efficiently.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Writer John Gerome also recognizes what has been a major thorn in many Nashvillians&#x2019; sides over the years - The common perception that Nashville is all honkytonkin&#x2019; and twangin&#x2019; and line dancin&#x2019;.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>It&#x2019;s ironic that Nashville, the city that <span id=\"lw_1215567363_4\" class=\"yshortcuts\" style=\"border-bottom: medium none; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; cursor: pointer; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;\">Robert Altman</span> poked fun at with his &#x2019;70s film &#x201C;Nashville&#x201D; and that spawned the cornpone TV series &#x201C;Hee Haw,&#x201D; is being celebrated as laid-back and hip &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D; but perhaps that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s come to.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>So whether you love the &#x201C;hee haw&#x201D; of Nashville or hate it, you can rest assured that the city we love is starting to gain some street cred.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Allison M. for the tip!</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/hwnna/229391470/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/http://flickr.com/photos/hwnna/229391470/&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">hwnna</a>. </em></p>\n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\">SHARETHIS.addEntry({ title: \"Life In Nashville: We&#8217;re An &#8220;Oasis,&#8221; Y&#8217;all\", url: \"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/09/life-in-nashville-were-an-oasis-yall/\" });</script></p>"
