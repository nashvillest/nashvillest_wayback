Literally. The team of riders that are biking across the United States will arrive here this weekend for the local chapter of the Ride:Well tour on Saturday. The Nashville ride is 25 miles, but there will be a 12 mile version for those out-of-shape bikers among us, and will start downtown at Rocketown (6th &amp; Shirley) at 9am.</p>\n<p>Registration for Saturday&#x2019;s ride starts at a $50 donation, but different levels of registration are available with different incentives. <a href=\"http://www.ridewelltour.com/CITYRIDES/NashvilleJuly12/tabid/1679/Default.aspx\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ridewelltour.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Register now online</a>, or on-site at 8am the day of the ride.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re lazy and bike-less like us, come out to support Blood:Water at their follow-up fundraising concert Sunday evening at <a href=\"http://3rdandlindsley.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;3rdandlindsley.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">3rd &amp; Lindsley</a>.
