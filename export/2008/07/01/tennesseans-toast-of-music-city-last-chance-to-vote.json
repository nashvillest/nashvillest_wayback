We live here, we work here, we play here, we eat here,  we buy music here, we get our dogs groomed here&#x2026; and we know where we like to do it. A few weeks back, the <em>Tennessean</em> put out a call for all of our favorites in their first annual <a href=\"http://data.tennessean.com/v2/bin/toast/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Toast of Music City Readers&#x2019; Choice Awards</a>. We&#x2019;re not sure how we missed it, but thankfully you&#x2019;ve still got one more day to vote for the best in every conceivable category from dog parks to coffee shops. We&#x2019;re talking dozens and dozens of categories. All participants even get a shot at winning a mysterious &#x201C;grand prize package.&#x201D; Voting ends tomorrow (July 2nd), so be sure to get your $0.02 in while you can!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/26/last-chance-to-vote-in-toast-of-music-city-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Last Chance To Vote In Toast Of Music City 2009\">Last Chance To Vote In Toast Of Music City 2009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/02/the-tennesseans-toast-of-music-is-back-for-another-crispy-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Tennessean&#x2019;s Toast Of Music City Is Back For Another Crispy Year\">The Tennessean&#x2019;s Toast Of Music City Is Back For Another Crispy Year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/16/the-other-best-of-toast-of-music-city-voting-ends-june-20/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Other Best-Of: Toast Of Music City Voting Ends June 20\">The Other Best-Of: Toast Of Music City Voting Ends June 20</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/28/toast-of-music-city-tastes-a-little-burned/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Toast Of Music City Tastes A Little Burned\">Toast Of Music City Tastes A Little Burned</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/16/capture-music-city-on-the-home-stretch/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Capture Music City: On The Home Stretch\">Capture Music City: On The Home Stretch</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
