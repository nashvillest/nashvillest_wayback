And since the whole premise of Restaurant.com is offering discount gift certificates ($50 for $20, $25 for $10, $10 for $3), an 80% discount is pretty hefty. You can snap up $50 gift certificates for $4 and $25 gift certificates for $2.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>While Restaurant.com doesn&#x2019;t hold a candle to <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleoriginals.com\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Originals</a>, they do have a handful of our local favorites &#x2013; Alley Cat Lounge, Fattoush Cafe and Gersthaus, among others. Be sure to read the terms of each gift certificate carefully. Most have a minimum purchase amount and they usually don&#x2019;t include alcohol or tips (bummer). Some restaurants have better deals than others, so sort through and take the opportunity to try something new.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Their search tool has been glitchy today from heavy traffic due to the sale, and some of our searches by zip code mysteriously return no results&#x2026; Just try your search again, and they&#x2019;ll eventually show up (or <a href=\"http://www.restaurant.com/rdc_site.net/listings.aspx?pgn=gcp&amp;StateID=&amp;zip=37215&amp;x=32&amp;y=8\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> for a link to our area search). The site is also excruciatingly slow, so you may want to try a down time &#x2013; but they&#x2019;re selling out quickly, so don&#x2019;t wait too long.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/09/new-nashville-eateries-ninety-percent-off-at-restaurant-com/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: New Nashville Eateries &amp; Ninety Percent Off At Restaurant.com\">New Nashville Eateries &amp; Ninety Percent Off At Restaurant.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/21/wednesday-fall-2009-nashville-originals-discount-gift-certificate-sale/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Wednesday: Fall 2009 Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificate Sale\">Wednesday: Fall 2009 Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificate Sale</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/02/sunset-grill-midtown-cafe-have-mercy-on-our-wallets/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sunset Grill &amp; Midtown Cafe Have Mercy On Our Wallets\">Sunset Grill &amp; Midtown Cafe Have Mercy On Our Wallets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/04/nashville-originals-restaurant-week/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Originals Restaurant Week September 15-21\">Nashville Originals Restaurant Week September 15-21</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/05/nashville-originals-great-food-on-the-cheap/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Originals: Great Food On The Cheap\">Nashville Originals: Great Food On The Cheap</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
