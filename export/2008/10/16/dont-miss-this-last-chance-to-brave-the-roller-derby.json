Track down your favorite local Rollergirl hawking $10 tickets before Saturday (or <a href=\"http://www.brownpapertickets.com/producerevent/37010?prod_id=3430\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.brownpapertickets.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">buy online</a>) or it&#x2019;s $15 at the door.

Doors are at 6pm at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/03/last-chance-to-get-your-roller-derby-fix-this-weekend-this-year-at-least/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Last Chance To Get Your Roller Derby Fix This Weekend (This Year, At Least)\">Last Chance To Get Your Roller Derby Fix This Weekend (This Year, At Least)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/14/nashville-rollergirls-at-home-again-nashvillest-psa-it-will-sell-out-dummies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Rollergirls Last Home Bout [Nashvillest PSA]: It Will Sell Out, Dummies\">Nashville Rollergirls Last Home Bout [Nashvillest PSA]: It Will Sell Out, Dummies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/09/saturday-nashville-rollergirls-back-at-home-to-take-on-new-orleans/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans\">Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/15/saturday-see-the-soon-to-be-homeless-rollergirls-close-the-2009-season/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saturday: See The Soon-To-Be-Homeless Rollergirls Close The 2009 Season\">Saturday: See The Soon-To-Be-Homeless Rollergirls Close The 2009 Season</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/07/nashville-rollergirls-want-you/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Rollergirls Want YOU\">Nashville Rollergirls Want YOU</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
