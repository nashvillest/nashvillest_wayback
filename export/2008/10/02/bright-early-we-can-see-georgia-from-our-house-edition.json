The Vice Presidential debate is upon us (8pm CST!) and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/NEWS0206/810020371/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Nashvillians are excited</a>. Last week, Nashville and Memphis both made the list of <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2008/09/27/memphis-ranks-two-in-percentage-of-debate-watchers/\" target=\"_blank\">top 5 cities</a> that viewed the first presidential debate (Nashville at 44% and Memphis at 49.5%). It looks like the <a href=\"http://tnelection.blogspot.com/2008/10/vice-presidential-debate-watch-parties.html\" target=\"_blank\">viewing party options</a> are limited this time around with the Democrats meeting at the <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=agj&amp;q=907+rosa+parks+blvd+nashville&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title\" target=\"_blank\">Obama HQ</a> and the Republicans hold down the fort on the <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=agj&amp;q=907+rosa+parks+blvd+nashville&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title\" target=\"_blank\">East side</a>, but that shouldn&#x2019;t stop us from one-upping Memphis this time.

Five days, ten hours, 43 minutes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Roma&#x2019;s Pizza shooting. </strong>A Roma&#x2019;s Pizza employee was <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9109961\" target=\"_blank\">shot in the head</a> last night after a robber entered the Green Hills store and demanded money. The shooter is still on the loose, so lock up, Green Hills.</li>\n<li><strong>No luck at all. </strong>Police also <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9110989\" target=\"_blank\">found a dead guy</a> in Centennial Park last night who had apparently been stabbed to death sometime after midnight.
