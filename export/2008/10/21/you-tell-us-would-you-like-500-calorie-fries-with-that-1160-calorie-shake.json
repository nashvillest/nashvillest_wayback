The requirement would only extend to chains with more than 10 locations, and the restaurants would have to display caloric content on their menus or menu boards. Only a handful of cities currently require this of restaurants, so it&#x2019;s a pretty big step to be considering.

Are you cool with it, or does it just rub you the wrong way? Do you think it should apply to independent restaurants too, or does the 10-restaurant qualifier seem a little restrictive? Do you think they should they just stick to regulating fast food chains?
