Sorry everyone! The good news is that you only have to wait one extra week until November 7 for the REAL opening. So block off your calendars now.&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p>We never thought the day would come, but the new <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081024/BUSINESS01/81024039/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Green Hills Trader Joe&#x2019;s is FINALLY opening</a> next Friday at 9am! For the early risers out there, they&#x2019;ll be doing a drawing for Trader Joe&#x2019;s goodie bags for everyone who lines up before 8:30. You can bet you&#x2019;ll see us there, because this is one neighbor we can&#x2019;t wait to meet.</p>\n<p><em>H/t <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jonarnold/status/974039296\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Arnold</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/10/nashvilles-first-chipotle-opens-friday-free-burritos-tomorrow-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville&#x2019;s First Chipotle Opens Friday; Free Burritos Tomorrow [Freebies]\">Nashville&#x2019;s First Chipotle Opens Friday; Free Burritos Tomorrow [Freebies]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
