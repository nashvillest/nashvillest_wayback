It was a win-win weekend for us in the football department&#x2026; well, make that a win-win-<em>win</em>. Not only did the Titans <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=63238\" target=\"_blank\">make quick work of the Ravens</a> in Baltimore (stretching their record to 5-0), but TSU mowed right over UT-Martin <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9127656\" target=\"_blank\">30-27 in overtime</a>, and who can forget Vandy? In a complete upset, the Commodores <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9121225\" target=\"_blank\">took down the Tigers 14-13</a> and extended their own record to 5-0. The fans are the ones who really stole the show, though, when ESPN admitted that they were <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081004/SPORTS0602/81004018/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">pretty impressed</a> with the GameDay turnout.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dear Senators.</strong> In honor of the Big Day&#xA0; tomorrow, Mayor Dean wrote a nice note welcoming the candidates into our fair city. And by &#x201C;nice note,&#x201D; we mean <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081005/OPINION03/810050414/1008/OPINION01\" target=\"_blank\">lengthy epistle</a> with a few policy recommendations of his own. Strangely enough, he doesn&#x2019;t mention sidewalks.</li>\n<li><strong>Save our Preds?</strong> The Preds have apparently defaulted on a $40M loan, which they&#x2019;re <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/sports/17621374/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">blaming on Boots</a> since Boots owes them $100M. There&#x2019;s also talk of that Canadian paying it off for us, but we all know he just wants to buy the team.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The Roma employee that was shot during the robbery last week <a href=\"http://www.wztv.com/newsroom/top_stories/wztv_vid_4399.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">died over the weekend</a> &#x2026; Dolly has <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2008/10/05/hello-dolly/\" target=\"_self\">thrown her endorsement</a> behind Sarah Palin, saying they have a lot in common. Sort of &#x2026; New celebrity baby in the house! Congrats to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081005/TUNEIN02/81005013/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Dierks Bentley and his wife</a> for the birth of Evalyn Day Bentley on Saturday &#x2026; We&#x2019;re glad everyone&#x2019;s coming to town for the debate because we can <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9127894\" target=\"_blank\">sell them stuff</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/mosesxan/1436712468/\" target=\"_self\">mosesxan</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
