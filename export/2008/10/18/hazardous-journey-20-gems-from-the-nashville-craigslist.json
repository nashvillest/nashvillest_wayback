Our loyal Craigslist tipster Sean keeps us informed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Re: Hazardous Journey</h3>\n<p>Why dont you simply explain what the job is. &#x201C;Safe return doubtful&#x201D; does&#x2019;nt put someone at ease. If it&#x2019;s an attempt at humor, fine. But people looking for employment are&#x2019;nt looking for comic relief. Get to the point and state the facts. Give clear concise information. You will stop getting flagged and start getting replies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>AND!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>RE: Hazardous Journey! (Nashville)</h3>\n<div><span>This guy is a creep. Don&#x2019;t respond to his ad&#x2019;s. It sounds to me like he is up to absolutely no good.&#xA0;<br>\nHe says he is an &#x201C;Ice Fisherman&#x201D;&#x2026;. EXPLAIN THIS TO ME CREEP&#x2026;&#xA0;<p></p>\n<p>&#x201C;HONOUR AND RECOGNITION, ILLUMINATION IN EVENT OF SUCCESS.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I lived in Massachusetts for 8 years, and we enjoyed our fish, and I know ALL about &#x201C;ice fishermen&#x201D;&#x2026;&#xA0;and they weren&#x2019;t honored, recognized, or illuminated for catching some fish. And if they didn&#x2019;t think&#xA0;they &#x201C;weren&#x2019;t going to return safely, they would have never gone&#x201D;&#x2026;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Your e-mail address is also suspicious. Fireworkstheywillcomeagain@&#x2026;&#x2026;..com&#xA0;</p>\n<p>You are a class &#x201C;A&#x201D; Creep. And you sound to me like you are trying to do something &#x201C;Un-American&#x201D; if you catch my drift.</p></span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/17/dangerous-journeys-not-allowed-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Hazardous Journeys Not Allowed [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Hazardous Journeys Not Allowed [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/29/that-just-might-work-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: That Just Might Work [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">That Just Might Work [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/22/the-best-missed-connections-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Best Missed Connections [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">The Best Missed Connections [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/09/gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist-great-first-dates/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Great First Dates\">Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Great First Dates</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/02/dirty-business-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Dirty Business [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Dirty Business [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
