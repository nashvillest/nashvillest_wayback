It&#x2019;s officially appropriate to rummage around in the attic for the long sleeves and down comforters. And stomp in some leaves or something.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Anyway, we&#x2019;re really excited about the weather, because it makes all of the following fun things more&#x2026; fun.</p>\n<p><strong>NASHVILLEST GUIDE TO FALL FAVORITES IN NASHVILLE</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvillezoo.org/events_detail.asp?eventID=28\" target=\"_blank\">Ghouls At Grassmere</a></strong> (submitted by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/people/kjamesh89/#main\" target=\"_blank\">kjamesh89</a>). This weekend and next, the Nashville Zoo hosts <em>Ghouls At Grassmere</em>, a spooky-yet-kid-friendly Halloween production complete with treats (lots of treats), special shows, hayrides, pumpkin painting, a costume parade, a &#x201C;Scary-Go-Round,&#x201D; carnival games, face painting, and special spooky decorations. Ghouls At Grassmere is October 17-19 and 24-26 from 5pm-9pm each night, and admission is $8/person for non-members.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Fall Festivals</strong>. Oktoberfest/German Street Fair has already passed, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean there&#x2019;s an end to the fall festivities. Celebrate at the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillefarmersmarket.org/festivals.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fall Harvest Festival</a> at the Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market on Saturday, or downtown Franklin&#x2019;s Pumpkinfest next Saturday (thanks <a href=\"http://disqus.com/people/7555e385cb79e8bce7e874330ed6455b/\" target=\"_blank\">Allison</a>). Don&#x2019;t forget the <a href=\"http://www.tnagmuseum.org/special.html\" target=\"_blank\">Music &amp; Molasses Arts &amp; Crafts Festival</a>! And <a href=\"http://nashvilleurbanharvest.org/pages/fall-party-2008\" target=\"_blank\">Harvest Parties</a>!&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Races</strong>. Fall is a great time to do some running outside, if you&#x2019;re into that physical activity sort of thing. Nashville&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.dsamt.org/buddywalk08.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buddy Walk</a> is this Saturday, as is East Nashville&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.inglewood5k.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Inglewood 5K</a>. Then we&#x2019;ve got a <a href=\"http://www.nashvillestriders.com/RaceCalendar.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bazillion others</a> every weekend through December.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Hiking</strong>. Reader <a href=\"http://disqus.com/people/e77da3d38f90b75e4de956ef40815cd0/\" target=\"_blank\">sarahtownsend</a> suggests hiking at <a href=\"http://www.radnorlake.org/lake_map.html\" target=\"_blank\">Radnor Lake</a> for an impressive view of the fall foliage. We like to trek around <a href=\"http://www.nashville.gov/parks/locations/warner.htm#\" target=\"_blank\">Percy Warner</a> ourselves, and we&#x2019;re sure there are even more great hiking spots if you&#x2019;re willing to drive a bit.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Apple picking</strong>. The apple season is almost over, but if you hurry you can enjoy crisp fall weather while you pick your own apples for warm apple pies. There&#x2019;s really nothing better. Our favorite pick-your-own apple orchard is <a href=\"http://www.jacksonsorchard.com/about_us.cgi?userid1=&amp;rnd=23788\" target=\"_blank\">Jackson&#x2019;s Orchard</a> in Bowling Green, KY. Their picking season is probably ending this week, so be sure to call before you haul yourselves all the way to Kentucky. Fresh apples are still available to buy through November, and the farm is very organized and kid-friendly. We have heard good things about <a href=\"http://www.prattsorchard.com/apples.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pratt&#x2019;s Orchard</a> in Lebanon as well.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Hockey</strong>. Some of our readers are big hockey fans, and they make sure that the hockey season stays on the forefront of our minds at all times. <a href=\"http://disqus.com/people/952752f279dcc168b02ca3e621caa5c7/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul</a> and <a href=\"http://disqus.com/people/920170b96e86f1721bbf884e440fcbb9/\" target=\"_blank\">Jim</a>&#xA0;brought up more than just the <a href=\"http://predators.nhl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Preds</a>, though. <a href=\"http://www.naihlonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Street hockey</a> also starts this week, if watching hockey isn&#x2019;t brutal enough for you. We didn&#x2019;t even know that there was a Nashville Street Hockey League, but we&#x2019;re glad it was brought to our attention.</li>\n<li><strong>Corn mazes</strong>. We&#x2019;ve been to <a href=\"http://www.rippavilla.org/cornmaze.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Rippavilla&#x2019;s</a> corn maze before, but we&#x2019;re looking forward to trying some different mazes this year. Does anyone know of a corn maze we could actually get lost in?! Try this new <a href=\"http://www.mazeplay.com/locator.php?maze=158\" target=\"_blank\">Dinosaur Maze</a> outside of Murfreesboro, or sort through <a href=\"http://www.pumpkinpatchesandmore.org/TNpmiddle.php\" target=\"_blank\">these</a> <a href=\"http://www.tnvacation.com/listing/corn-mazes/?region=2&amp;results=15\" target=\"_blank\">listings</a> and report back on your findings.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<div><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/jeffhenshaw/2935367313/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jeff Henshaw</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></div>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/13/fall-favorites-in-nashville/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fall Favorites In Nashville?\">Fall Favorites In Nashville?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/01/free-fall-weekend-at-cheekwood-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Fall Weekend At Cheekwood [Freebies]\">Free Fall Weekend At Cheekwood [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/23/nashvillest-guide-to-festival-fun-lets-get-this-party-started/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashvillest Guide To Festival Fun: Let&#x2019;s Get This Party Started\">Nashvillest Guide To Festival Fun: Let&#x2019;s Get This Party Started</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/02/the-weekendist-full-blown-fall-fest-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Full-Blown Fall Fest Edition\">The Weekendist: Full-Blown Fall Fest Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/15/bright-early-we-woke-up-and-it-was-fall-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: We Woke Up And It Was Fall Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: We Woke Up And It Was Fall Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
