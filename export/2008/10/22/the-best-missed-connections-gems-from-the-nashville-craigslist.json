In Nashville, they&#x2019;re usually just borderline scary once you realize that these people are dead serious. But once in a while, the vigilant Missed-Connection browser can find something good, and our friend Morgan Z. happened upon a handful of pretty hilarious ones. They were too good not to share. Missed Connection Number 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"http://nashville.craigslist.org/mis/852575449.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([\" _trackevent','outbound-article','nashville.craigslist.org']);'=\"\" target=\"_blank\">At the Gas Station&#x2026; &#x2013; w4m &#x2013; 25 (Nashville)</a></h3>\n<p>I was so excited to finally be putting gas in my car that I barely noticed you standing there looking at me.</p>\n<p>Me:<br>\n25 years old<br>\nblonde<br>\n5&#x2032; tall<br>\n100 lbs</p>\n<p>You:<br>\nmid-40&#x2019;s<br>\nsweaty<br>\nripped and stained blue jeans<br>\nno shirt</p>\n<p>When you came up to me and asked me if anyone had told me that I was the &#x2018;purdiest little thing in Nashville&#x2019;, I knew it was meant to be. I could hardly resist you with your hairy chest and giant protruding beer belly! I blushed and wasn&#x2019;t sure what to say besides &#x2018;thank you&#x2019;. We connected there for a moment&#x2026;me, filling up my tank as quickly as possible and you, running your tongue through the spaces where your teeth used to be.</p>\n<p>Maybe we will run into each other again&#x2026;I&#x2019;m sure that you don&#x2019;t have internet in your home underneath the overpass and probably won&#x2019;t read this message. If not&#x2026;well&#x2026;pumping gas just won&#x2019;t be the same without you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Missed Connection Number 2:&#xA0;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"http://nashville.craigslist.org/mis/860562621.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([\" _trackevent','outbound-article','nashville.craigslist.org']);'=\"\" target=\"_blank\">man with red hair and cape &#x2013; w4m &#x2013; 24 (west end)</a></h3>\n<p>FIND ME PLEASE!!!</p>\n<p>you had me take this picture for you in centennial park and I didn&#x2019;t have the nerve to talk to you.</p>\n<p>Please find me you are my night in shining armor</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i38.tinypic.com/bezfgy.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p></blockquote>\n<p>As for Missed Connection Number 3&#x2026; Well, we&#x2019;ll just <a href=\"http://i36.tinypic.com/ofvaf6.png\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([\" _trackevent','outbound-article','i36.tinypic.com']);'=\"\" target=\"_blank\">link you to that one</a>.
