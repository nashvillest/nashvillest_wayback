Right now we&#x2019;ve got <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/18/capture-music-city-let-the-voting-begin/\" target=\"_blank\">Capture Music City</a>, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/16/music-city-madness-just-what-we-needed/\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Madness</a>, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/05/mta-jingle-contest-only-in-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">MTA Jingle Contest</a>, <a href=\"http://www.themusiccitysongwriter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Songwriting Contest</a> and <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/18/musical-diversity-thats-us/\" target=\"_blank\">The Flip Side of Nashville</a> contest. Some contests are unique, some are overdone, and some are a miserable failure (some are a combination of these). We just love the contests that require videos and let us view them as they roll in. Thank you, Flip Side of Nashville contest, for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/groups_videos?name=FlipSideNashville\" target=\"_blank\">this afternoon&#x2019;s entertainment</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Incidentally, if any of you Nashvillians out there are in need of a trip to Nashville (the grand prize), get to work. There&#x2019;s only 8 videos in the group right now, and we have a feeling that about half of them don&#x2019;t count as legitimate entries. The contest deadline is <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">August 25</span>&#xA0;(er, looks like they extended it to September 1&#x2026; wonder why), and they&#x2019;re doling out over 1,000 prizes. The odds of winning are in your favor.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/18/convention-visitors-bureau-produces-their-own-flip-side-video-ha-ha-ha/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau Produces Their Own Flip Side Video [Ha, Ha, Ha]\">Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau Produces Their Own Flip Side Video [Ha, Ha, Ha]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/12/nashvillest-loves-you-hannahs-nashville-boroughs-poster-giveaway/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashvillest Loves You: Hannah&#x2019;s &#x201C;Nashville Boroughs&#x201D; Poster Giveaway\">Nashvillest Loves You: Hannah&#x2019;s &#x201C;Nashville Boroughs&#x201D; Poster Giveaway</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/18/musical-diversity-thats-us/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Musical Diversity, That&#x2019;s Us!\">Musical Diversity, That&#x2019;s Us!</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
