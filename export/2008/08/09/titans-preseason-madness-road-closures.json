Football season is upon us, and if you&#x2019;re not going to the game, you may want to avoid being anywhere near the stadium after about 4pm today. With all the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/24/dont-miss-this-2008-tomato-art-fest/\" target=\"_blank\">Tomato Art festivities</a> happening around town, that may be pretty hard to do.
