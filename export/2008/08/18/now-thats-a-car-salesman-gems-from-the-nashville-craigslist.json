It&#x2019;s a moment worth memorializing.&#xA0;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"http://nashville.craigslist.org/m4w/797138239.html\" target=\"_blank\">I&#x2019;m trying to sell a car and need a girl in a bikini &#x2013; 25 (Davidson County. Bellevue)</a></h3>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Basically, I&#x2019;m not looking for love. Yeah, sorry. But anyway, if you just happen to be wearing a bikini sometime this weekend, here&#x2019;s an opportunity to make a quick buck. Basically, I have this total ****box car that I&#x2019;m trying to sell. It&#x2019;s old, it&#x2019;s ugly, it&#x2019;s got a busted trunk. I need to take some pics of it with a girl in a bikini and post them in CL auto sales, just to drum up some interest on it and see if I can sell this thing.</p>\n<p>And, the more the merrier. Maybe you and your girlfriends are gonna be lounging by the pool this weekend. Why not pose provocatively on various parts of the car. $10 a girl. With a maximum of four girls, unless of course, you have a sorority and they all want to pile on it, then I&#x2019;ll gladly let all of you take the $40 and do whatever you want with it. C&#x2019;mon, $40 will buy you and your friends a pretty good night on the town, right? And the feeling you&#x2019;ll get from working for that $40 will make it more memorable.</p>\n<p>I promise I&#x2019;m not a sleaze. I won&#x2019;t touch you. I won&#x2019;t have you do something crazy with the shift knob. Just sit in the seats. Lay on the hood, and maybe bend over a little bit and act like your waxing this big dent that&#x2019;s in the trunk. 5 minutes tops. I promise.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/jacobs_and_son/192808565/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>jacobs and son</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/14/gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist-reform-school/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Reform School\">Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Reform School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/19/in-light-of-recent-football-events-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: In Light Of Recent Football Events&#x2026; [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">In Light Of Recent Football Events&#x2026; [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/09/gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist-great-first-dates/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Great First Dates\">Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Great First Dates</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/02/truck-comes-complete-with-two-strips-of-rawhide-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Truck Comes Complete With Two Strips Of Rawhide [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Truck Comes Complete With Two Strips Of Rawhide [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/28/designers-dream-sectional-sofa-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Designer&#x2019;s Dream Sectional Sofa [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Designer&#x2019;s Dream Sectional Sofa [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
