Really, we do. There&#x2019;s never a shortage of <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/28/frist-fridays-summer-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\">interesting things</a> happening there, and a lot of them <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/08/frist-freebies-its-a-good-time-to-be-a-kid/\" target=\"_blank\">happen to be free</a>. Unfortunately, the limitations on the freebies often mean that we can&#x2019;t fit them into our schedules, so we were excited to learn that the Frist Center will be <a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=648\" target=\"_blank\">free </a><em><a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=648\" target=\"_blank\">all day</a></em><a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=648\" target=\"_blank\"> tomorrow</a> in honor of the Tennessean&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.NashvilleShopping.com/mscheap\" target=\"_blank\">Ms. Cheap</a>. In addition to free admission (10am-9pm), Ms. Cheap will be making an appearance in the auditorium from 11am-1pm to meet and talk with guests, a &#x201C;Ms. Cheap lunch special&#x201D; will be $5 and there will be a Ms. Cheap discount in the gift shop (25%) and on membership ($5 off). And no Nashville event would be complete without free music (6pm-8pm).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080803/ENTERTAINMENT0507/808030317/-1/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">new exhibit</a> at the Frist, <em>Color as Field: American Painting, 1950-75</em>, is a collection of gigantic paintings that immerse the viewer in color fields, and is the first major exhibition to explore the concept and technique of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Field\" target=\"_blank\">color field painting</a>. We can take or leave some of the exhibits that cycle through the Frist, but this one is so different and unique that it&#x2019;s been on our must-see list.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Can&#x2019;t make it tomorrow? Don&#x2019;t sweat it. <a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=584\" target=\"_blank\">Family Day</a> is coming up on August 17, with free admission from 1pm-5:30pm, and there&#x2019;s a free <em><a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=595\" target=\"_blank\">Jazz On The Move</a></em> concert this Sunday at 3pm that also includes free admission to the galleries. Don&#x2019;t forget&#xA0;<a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=636\" target=\"_blank\">Free College Nights</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/02/19/double-your-free-frist-center-pleasure-this-weekendfreebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Double Your Free Frist Center Pleasure This Weekend [Freebies]\">Double Your Free Frist Center Pleasure This Weekend [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/23/tounge-twisters-frist-first-free-day-more-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tounge Twisters: Frist First Free Day &amp; More [Freebies]\">Tounge Twisters: Frist First Free Day &amp; More [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/13/double-the-free-frist-fun-this-week-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Double The Free Frist Fun This Week [Freebies]\">Double The Free Frist Fun This Week [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/08/happy-holidays-from-the-frist-center-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Holidays From The Frist Center [Freebies]\">Happy Holidays From The Frist Center [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/01/28/free-admission-at-the-frist-center-through-february-19-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Admission At The Frist Center Through February 19 [Freebies]\">Free Admission At The Frist Center Through February 19 [Freebies]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
