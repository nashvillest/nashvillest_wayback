You may remember late last year, when reports filtered in that the ladies of <a href=\"http://wheresthesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Las Paletas</a>&#xA0;had been tricked into a <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_bt\" target=\"_blank\">Throwdown with Iron Chef Bobby Flay</a>. They&#x2019;ve kept quiet on who won, but we can&#x2019;t imagine anyone (no, not even an Iron Chef) making a better popsicle than Las Paletas. The show was taped in November, and we&#x2019;ve been kept in the dark until now &#x2013; the show airs tonight at 8pm, and Las Paletas is hosting an outdoor screening in their parking lot off 12th South. Hey, we&#x2019;ll be there, if only for the opportunity to get paletas after 7pm!</p>\n<p>H/t <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/bites/2008/08/the_thrilla_in_vanilla_las_pal.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bites</a>.
