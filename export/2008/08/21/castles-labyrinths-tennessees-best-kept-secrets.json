Thanks to the internet, we&#x2019;ve discovered that we actually have both. The self-proclaimed &#x201C;Castlefinders&#x201D; at <a href=\"http://www.dupontcastle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dupontcastle.com</a>&#xA0;are not only building their own castle, but they have scoured the country and created a database of castles or castle-like buildings. There are <a href=\"http://www.dupontcastle.com/castles/index.htm#tn\" target=\"_blank\">several listed close to Nashville</a>, but it&#x2019;s sort of funny when you realize that one is the well-known Castle Recording Studio, and another is an old mine. These Castlefinders define a castle as &#x201C;<em>something that captures the imagination, that has the ability to transport you to another time and place.</em>&#x201D; They even offer free&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.dupontcastle.com/castles/dupont4.htm\" target=\"_blank\">castle-building lessons</a> (aka help them build their castle), for a DIY adventure!</p>\n<p>We have significantly <a href=\"http://wwll.veriditas.labyrinthsociety.org/locate-a-labyrinth-results?instance_id=303&amp;state=TN&amp;prev_action=locate&amp;action=locate&amp;offset=20\" target=\"_blank\">more labyrinths</a>, some at places we drive past every day. It turns out that a lot of churches and cathedrals have labyrinths on their properties as a place for reflection and meditation. Now, if only we could find the internet database of dungeons.</p>\n<p><em>[Thanks to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/64675079@N00/2783333858/\" target=\"_blank\">crionox</a> for both tips and the photos!]</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/01/beyond-elmington-park-the-tennessee-renaissance-festival/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Beyond Elmington Park: The Tennessee Renaissance Festival\">Beyond Elmington Park: The Tennessee Renaissance Festival</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
