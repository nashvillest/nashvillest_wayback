For the entire month of September, Cold Stone has been supporting the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and they&#x2019;re capping it off with an nationwide party that comes complete with free ice cream. From 5pm-8pm tonight, anyone can drop by Cold Stone (<a href=\"http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/google/stores/store_locator.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">locations</a>) and snag some free &#x201C;Jack&#x2019;s Creation&#x201D; or &#x201C;Emily&#x2019;s Creation,&#x201D; new signature creations inspired by two children in the Make-a-Wish program. The new flavors actually sound pretty disgusting to us &#x2013; Nutter Butter and Marshmallow &#x2013; But the whole thing is just so&#x2026; sweet.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/yanec/933032497/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>yanec</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/28/cool-end-to-national-ice-cream-month-free-bravo-gelato-on-saturday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Cool End To National Ice Cream Month: Free Bravo Gelato On Saturday\">Cool End To National Ice Cream Month: Free Bravo Gelato On Saturday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/20/free-ice-cream-today-at-dippin-dots/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Ice Cream Today At Dippin&#x2019; Dots\">Free Ice Cream Today At Dippin&#x2019; Dots</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/23/make-a-wish-on-three-inch-subs-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Make A Wish On Three Inch Subs [Freebies]\">Make A Wish On Three Inch Subs [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/21/more-sweet-treats-dunkin-donuts-iced-coffee-day-almost-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Sweet Treats: Dunkin Donuts&#x2019; Iced Coffee Day [Almost Freebies]\">More Sweet Treats: Dunkin Donuts&#x2019; Iced Coffee Day [Almost Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/10/sweet-snacks-take-a-bite-of-jeff-fisher/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sweet Snacks: Take A Bite Of Jeff Fisher\">Sweet Snacks: Take A Bite Of Jeff Fisher</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
