We&#x2019;ve received tons of calls from friends &amp; family around the country wondering why exactly we don&#x2019;t have gas. And well, we just can&#x2019;t answer that for them. Everyone seems to have a different story about if the gas shortage is just a rumor, the percentages of gas stations without gas, the actual role that recent hurricanes played in this weekend&#x2019;s mayhem, and on and on and on&#x2026; It would be more entertaining if we weren&#x2019;t the butt of the joke. Alas, we&#x2019;ll just hang out at home and keep wondering, because it doesn&#x2019;t seem like anyone is going to tell us the real story anytime soon. Here&#x2019;s the story as it&#x2019;s made its way around the media in the past 24 hours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://drudgereport.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;drudgereport.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Drudge Report</a>. First, we made the Drudge Report on Friday in what may be the understatement of the century (&#x201C;Some Nashville area stations out of gas&#x201D;). Drudge linked to <a href=\"http://www.wztv.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/3956afe9-www.fox17.com.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wztv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">WZTV</a>, and from there things just went downhill.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://consumerist.com/5052643/85-of-gas-stations-in-nashville-tn-are-without-gas-right-now\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;consumerist.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Consumerist</a>. We squealed aloud when we saw the story on Consumerist. Needless to say, we&#x2019;re huge Gawker Media fans. They linked to the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080919/NEWS/80919020\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessean</a>, and in typical Consumerist-commenter fashion, they all began drumming up conspiracy theories. It&#x2019;s awesome.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/09/19/nashville.gas/index.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.cnn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a>. CNN would just like everyone to know that the gas shortage is just a rumor. Interestingly enough, we never heard any rumors about gas shortages. We just noticed that none of the eight gas stations by Nashvillest headquarters had gas. It took a lot of brain power, but we finally deduced that there was a gas shortage. CNN says we&#x2019;re wrong.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tennesseeanytime.org/governor/viewArticleContent.do?id=1279\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennesseeanytime.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Gov. Bredesen</a>. Then good ol&#x2019; Phil came to the rescue by actually recognizing that something was awry. He says our pipelines are good to go, but mentions that it probably isn&#x2019;t a bad idea to conserve a little.</li>\n<li><strong>Local news. </strong>The <a href=\"http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080920/BUSINESS01/809200383\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessean</a> says that AAA says that 50-60% of our stations are still without gas. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9046121\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">WTVF</a> brings us the same worn out old story, but this time from the perspective of the cabbies. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/17521383/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">WSMV</a> says that AAA says we could still be waiting a week, even though Bredesen says we&#x2019;ve got the fuel.
