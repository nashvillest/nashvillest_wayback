This is the day when you should shy away from reading most blogs (except ours) unless you just love sticking everything you read into an <a href=\"http://www.fissio.com/pirate.pl\" target=\"_blank\">English to Pirate Translator</a>. Which is way too much effort for us. We&#x2019;ll probably be laying pretty low on the whole talking-like-pirates thing, but we wanted to make sure everyone knew about their entitlement to talk like pirates today, and today only. If you really want to tick off your friends, be sure to only post to your Twitter account from <a href=\"http://postlikeapirate.com/twitter.php\" target=\"_blank\">this translator</a> today as well.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re curious though: What made International Talk Like A Pirate Day catch on? Why hasn&#x2019;t Sneak Some Zucchini On Your Neighbor&#x2019;s Front Porch Day (<a href=\"http://www.brownielocks.com/august.html\" target=\"_blank\">August 8</a>) been such a success? Oh well. Be sure to celebrate Big Whopper Liar Day <a href=\"http://www.brownielocks.com/september.html\" target=\"_blank\">tomorrow</a>. Don&#x2019;t worry, we don&#x2019;t know what that means either.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/kelliente\" target=\"_blank\">@Kelliente</a> for the reminder and <a href=\"http://blog.davemadethat.com/2008/09/19/dont-forget-to-speak-like-a-scurvy-pirate-this-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Delaney</a> for the translator links!</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
