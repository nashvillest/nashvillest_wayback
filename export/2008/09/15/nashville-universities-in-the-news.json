Mafiaoza&#x2019;s is impossible to enter on 2-for-1 Tuesdays and Belmont is ever flailing the &#x201C;Debate &#x2018;08&#x2033; signage. We poke fun, but we really are proud of our local universities. We hear about Vandy all the time, but Belmont and Lipscomb have had some pretty significant accomplishments in recent weeks and we&#x2019;d like to give them a pat on the back, too.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Belmont University</strong> set <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/09/01/daily31.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">record enrollment</a> at 5,000 students this year, a full two years ahead of schedule. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine them all crammed on that campus, but they seem to be doing just fine (well, except for their <a href=\"http://thatismessedup.com/2008/09/10/parking-woes-at-belmont-university/\" target=\"_blank\">parking woes</a>). <strong>Lipscomb University</strong> also set <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/09/08/daily26.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">record enrollment</a> at 3,000 students this year. And aside from letting in massive amounts of freshmen, <strong>Belmont&#x2019;s</strong> fairly new entrepreneurship program has been ranked one of the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/09/08/daily27.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">best in the nation</a> by <em>Entrepreneur Magazine</em> and <em>The Princeton Review</em>. Not to be outdone, <strong>Lipscomb</strong> raced to have the first college of pharmacy in Middle Tennessee. Oh wait, then <strong>Belmont</strong><a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080822/MICRO020703/808220336/1475\" target=\"_blank\"> started one too</a>, so no one really got to be first. And earlier this year, <strong>Belmont</strong> was paid a backhanded compliment by <em>BusinessWeek</em>, ranking as its 89th Best Undergrad <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/02/25/daily27.html\" target=\"_blank\">B-School</a> pick. B stands for Belmont, right?&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/chenoweth/2568768123/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Chenowith</a>.&#xA0;</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/12/bright-early-rumor-mill-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Rumor Mill Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Rumor Mill Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
