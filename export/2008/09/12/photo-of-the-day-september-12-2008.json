So we break from our usual POTD programming to bring you this photo from the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillezoo.org/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.nashvillezoo.org&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Zoo</a> of the red panda looking pretty darn cute. We won&#x2019;t be having good zoo weather for much longer, so this might actually inspire us to make a trip of our own. Happy Friday!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/joshbousel/139460245/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Bousel</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/13/photo-of-the-day-march-13-2008-feel-good-friday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: March 13, 2008 [Feel Good Friday]\">Photo Of The Day: March 13, 2008 [Feel Good Friday]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/02/photo-of-the-day-september-2-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: September 2, 2008\">Photo Of The Day: September 2, 2008</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/03/photo-of-the-day-september-3-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: September 3, 2008\">Photo Of The Day: September 3, 2008</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/05/photo-of-the-day-september-5-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: September 5, 2008\">Photo Of The Day: September 5, 2008</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/24/photo-of-the-day-september-24-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Photo Of The Day: September 24, 2008\">Photo Of The Day: September 24, 2008</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
