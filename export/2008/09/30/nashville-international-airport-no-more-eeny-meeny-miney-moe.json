Instead of trying to pick the security line that has the lowest number of dawdling tourists, travelers at BNA will now be identifying themselves as &#x201C;Families,&#x201D; &#x201C;Casual Travelers&#x201D; or &#x201C;Expert Travelers.&#x201D; Expert travelers are, as one might expect, those who fly very frequently and fly light. On the other hand, a casual traveler seems to be someone who also is familiar with TSA regulations, but may have multiple carry on items. Where are all of the dawdling tourists supposed to go? Oh, in the &#x201C;Family&#x201D; line, of course! Travelers who may need assistance or are unfamiliar with the TSA drill get to stand in line with the small children. Unfortunately, none of these changes mean that we can keep our shoes on.
