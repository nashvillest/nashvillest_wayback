This weekend, Purity Dairies&#x2019; new <em style=\"font-style: italic;\">Jeff Fisher&#x2019;s Football Frenzy</em> ice cream hits shelves, and we think it&#x2019;s pretty awesome. What flavor is Jeff Fisher? We&#x2019;re glad you asked. Jeff Fisher is apparently vanilla (heh, heh) with a smooth caramel swirl and has peanut butter footballs mixed in.&#xA0;</p>\n<blockquote><p><em style=\"font-style: italic;\">&#x201C;The introduction of <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Jeff Fisher&#x2019;s Football Frenzy</span> is Purity&#x2019;s way of thanking the Titans for bringing entertainment, excitement and great sportsmanship to Tennessee for ten years,&#x201D; said Tim Tracy, ice cream sales manager at Purity Dairies. &#x201C;The Purity Dairies family is proud to share a hometown with the Titans, and we are pleased to share <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Jeff Fisher&#x2019;s Football Frenzy</span> with ice cream lovers and Titans fans alike.&#x201D;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Purity Dairies is matching the new flavor with a <a href=\"http://www.puritydairies.com/contest/greatcallcoach/information.html\" target=\"_blank\">Titans contest</a> as well. Ten lucky Titans lovers will win a pair of Titans tickets, VIP Tailgating Party passes, and hotel accommodations for the night. The contest deadline is October 8. If you win, maybe you can get Jeff Fisher to autograph your ice cream for you.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/01/nashville-traditions-miss-marthas-crankin-contest/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Traditions: Miss Martha&#x2019;s Crankin&#x2019; Contest\">Nashville Traditions: Miss Martha&#x2019;s Crankin&#x2019; Contest</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/12/this-weekend-miss-martha-gets-crankin-a-little-earlier-this-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Miss Martha Gets Crankin&#x2019; A Little Earlier This Year\">This Weekend: Miss Martha Gets Crankin&#x2019; A Little Earlier This Year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/22/and-todays-free-dairy-dose-is/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: And Today&#x2019;s Free Dairy Dose Is&#x2026;\">And Today&#x2019;s Free Dairy Dose Is&#x2026;</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/11/miss-marthas-annual-crankin-will-cool-down-nashville-this-saturday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Miss Martha&#x2019;s Annual Crankin&#x2019; Will Cool Down Nashville This Saturday\">Miss Martha&#x2019;s Annual Crankin&#x2019; Will Cool Down Nashville This Saturday</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
