One Female Bed Filler !!! &#x2013; 35 (Nashville, TN)</a></h3>\n<p><em>I&#x2019;m just another busy person always on the go. I recently moved to a new place and bought a fantastic bed that I love. While so caught up in my day to day life, I have not had time to develop a romantic relationship lately. But when I come home at the end of the day and get in bed, it feels very empty.&#xA0;</em></p>\n<p><em>I have thus decided to take applications for a bed-filler.&#xA0;</em></p>\n<p>This is NOT a sex thing. If anything, it might be more appropriate to post this in the housewares section&#x2026; but anyways.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Me:&#xA0;<br>\n-35years old, straight single male&#xA0;<br>\n-5&#x2019;10&#x201D;, black hair, brown eyes, Med. build&#xA0;<br>\n-often restless/occupied when I get in bed; in need of soothing, relaxation&#xA0;</p>\n<p>My bed:&#xA0;<br>\n-1 King bed, located in nice room in nice suite.&#xA0;<br>\n-clean sheets&#xA0;<br>\n-2 new pillows for sleeping &#x2013; none of those annoying throw pillows&#xA0;<br>\n-1 brown fleece blanket decorated with white squares (don&#x2019;t ask)&#xA0;<br>\n-room temperature kept cool as to facilitate snuggling (see below)&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I require:&#xA0;<br>\n-one straight, single woman&#xA0;<br>\n-between the ages of 18 and 37 years old&#xA0;<br>\n-minimum 5 feet tall, 5&#x2019;5&#x201D; is better, 5&#x2019;9&#x201D; is most desireable and also the maximum height sought.&#xA0;<br>\n-must practice good hygiene, smell pleasant and have soft skin.&#xA0;<br>\n-piercings and tattoos to be considered on individual basis&#xA0;<br>\n-must enthusiastically cuddle, snuggle and spoon me&#xA0;<br>\n-must NOT scratch herself excessively in the morning.&#xA0;<br>\n-must limit alcohol intake to 2 beers on any night she is acting as bed-filler&#xA0;<br>\n-must seek medical consul if she consistently snores when not drunk, sick&#xA0;<br>\n-should occasionally play with my hair&#xA0;</p>\n<p>What the successful applicant receives:&#xA0;<br>\n-the satisfaction of helping me sleep better&#xA0;<br>\n-sleeping with a guy who always smells nice&#xA0;<br>\n-free massages ( just a gift I have)&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Applicants who can demonstrate ESP skills, thus knowing which nights and at what times I need my bed-filler without my explicit request, will be given priority in the short listing phase. Amusing and/or insightful pillow talk may be rewarded with kisses or sex(to be decided at the discretion of the bed-filler). Please send pic.&#xA0;<br>\nThanks and good luck!&#xA0;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/jamesyu/366732694/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>jamesjyu</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/13/scalp-not-included-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Scalp Not Included [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Scalp Not Included [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/22/the-best-missed-connections-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Best Missed Connections [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">The Best Missed Connections [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/18/hazardous-journey-20-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Hazardous Journey 2.0 [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Hazardous Journey 2.0 [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/09/a-match-made-in-heaven-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: A Match Made In Heaven [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">A Match Made In Heaven [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/09/gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist-great-first-dates/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Great First Dates\">Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Great First Dates</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
