Who can afford $40-60 for a show every week &#x2013; Or even every month? (Hint: Not us.) But there are certain artists whose music seems to have been crafted perfectly to be heard at The Ryman, and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ironandwine\" target=\"_blank\">Iron &amp; Wine</a> is one of them. We&#x2019;re about to go crazy waiting for Sunday to roll around. Opening for Iron &amp; Wine is Portland, OR based <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/blitzentrapper\" target=\"_blank\">Blitzen Trapper</a>, whose music we&#x2019;ve just recently heard in anticipation of this show. Blitzen Trapper is a perfect touring match for Iron &amp; Wine, with their catchy, up-tempo folk-pop in the vein of Wilco (think of a gleeful Wilco and you&#x2019;ve pretty much got Blitzen Trapper). Tickets are still available, but starting to look scarce, so grab &#x2018;em now.</p>\n<p>Iron &amp; Wine with Blitzen Trapper<br>\nSunday, November 23 at 8pm<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B0040FAA9BD3573?artistid=876377&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60\" target=\"_blank\">Buy Tickets</a></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/24234870@N07/2571554520/\" target=\"_blank\">The Current Online</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/06/the-weekendist-shortest-weekend-of-the-year-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Shortest Weekend Of The Year Edition\">The Weekendist: Shortest Weekend Of The Year Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/02/19/this-just-in-ben-folds-at-the-ryman-april-7/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Just In: Ben Folds At The Ryman April 7\">This Just In: Ben Folds At The Ryman April 7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/13/tonight-iron-chef-icy-treats/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: Iron Chef &amp; Icy Treats\">Tonight: Iron Chef &amp; Icy Treats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/30/life-is-complete-flight-of-the-conchords-at-the-ryman/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Life Is Complete: Flight Of The Conchords At The Ryman\">Life Is Complete: Flight Of The Conchords At The Ryman</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
