They&#x2019;re offering voters a <a href=\"http://www.benjerry.com/features/i_voted/\" target=\"_blank\">free scoop of ice cream</a> today from 5pm-8pm. We already voted, but early voting counts!&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Free ice cream in November a little too&#x2026; chilly? How about a nice, warm, patriotic donut from <a href=\"http://krispykreme.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">Krispy Kreme</a>? Seriously, vote. Do it for the food.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/hot_vote_now08_pop.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1215\" title=\"hot_vote_now08_pop\" src=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/hot_vote_now08_pop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\"></a></p>\n<p>Oh! There&#x2019;s more! Starbucks is doling out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/starbucks\" target=\"_blank\">free tall brewed coffees</a> to voters today, which may come in handy if you&#x2019;re standing in line before work. But don&#x2019;t forget about <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/23/cremas-got-the-coffee-spirit/\" target=\"_blank\">Crema</a>, they&#x2019;ve been giving away free coffee to early voters for weeks.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 10:30AM</strong>: Reader <a href=\"http://annieblogs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Annie</a> sent us a tip that Frothy Monkey is also giving out free small drip coffee to voters today. The Nashville Scene&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/bites/2008/11/vote_early_and_mooch_often_ele.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bites blog</a> also offers a roundup with a few extra offerings, and check <a href=\"http://forums.slickdeals.net/showthread.php?threadid=989221\" target=\"_blank\">SlickDeals</a> for a frequently updated nationwide list of offerings. We&#x2019;re sorry to report that our area Chick-fil-a locations are not participating in the rumored &#x201C;Free Chicken Sandwich For Voters&#x201D; offer (they were pretty hostile when we called to ask about it). Guess we&#x2019;re filling up on donuts, ice cream and coffee today!</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 12:00PM</strong>: <a href=\"http://grimeys.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grimey&#x2019;s</a> is giving everyone with an &#x201C;I Voted&#x201D; sticker 10% off their purchase today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/23/cremas-got-the-coffee-spirit/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Crema&#x2019;s Got The Coffee Spirit\">Crema&#x2019;s Got The Coffee Spirit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/21/more-sweet-treats-dunkin-donuts-iced-coffee-day-almost-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Sweet Treats: Dunkin Donuts&#x2019; Iced Coffee Day [Almost Freebies]\">More Sweet Treats: Dunkin Donuts&#x2019; Iced Coffee Day [Almost Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/04/15/wipe-away-the-tax-day-blues-with-free-stuff-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Wipe Away The Tax Day Blues With Free Stuff [Freebies]\">Wipe Away The Tax Day Blues With Free Stuff [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/20/inauguration-day-means-free-doughnuts-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Inauguration Day Means&#x2026; Free Doughnuts?
