It seems like it was quite the weekend for teenage prison breaks! Three 16-year olds being transported in a state van <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/17994225/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">hopped in the driver&#x2019;s seat</a> and took off when the guard got out to inspect damage from an accident. One of the three turned himself in, but the other two are still on the loose. In a separate incident, another teen <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081115/NEWS03/81115015/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">escaped from a restaurant</a>. He asked to use the restroom and then jumped into a white car that pulled up to the building. He&#x2019;s still on the run, too, and is considered dangerous.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>10-0!</strong> So how about those Titans? When they were behind at halftime, we thought this might be the end of the road. But they pulled through and took down Jacksonville 24-14 to bring their record <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081117/SPORTS01/811170349/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">to an unbelievable 10-0</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Stopping the h8.</strong> An estimated 200 Tennesseans made it out to the <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9358559\" target=\"_blank\">Proposition 8 protest</a> at the Metro Courthouse on Saturday. The protest was part of a national series that took place in dozens of cities across the country.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The federal government gave $1.2M to United Neighborhood Health Services to provide <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081116/NEWS07/811160409/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">free primary health care</a> to Nashville&#x2019;s homeless &#x2026; It&#x2019;s looking like the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/politics/17995930/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">auto industry bailout</a> might be happening after all, which is good news for Tennessee&#x2019;s plants &#x2026; Wachovia&#x2019;s ongoing troubles <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=64174\" target=\"_blank\">might be screwing over</a> the developers of the new 5th &amp; Main condos in East Nashville &#x2026; A woman <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9360769\" target=\"_blank\">set herself on fire</a> in a West Nashville church yesterday.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunndog818/3036810390/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">sunndog818</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/11/bright-early-our-own-prison-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Our Own Prison Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Our Own Prison Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
