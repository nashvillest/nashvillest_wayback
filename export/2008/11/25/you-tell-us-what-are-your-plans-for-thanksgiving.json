What are your plans for Thanksgiving? Do you lay low and have a nice meal at home? Do you hit the road and spend time with family and friends in other states? Are you the bravest of the brave (or maybe just crazed) who face those Black Friday sales?</p>\n<p>Over the next few days, we&#x2019;ll try to bring you some ideas and aids to make your Nashville Thanksgiving a little easier this year. But for now, what are your plans and traditions for Thanksgiving?</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/thankgod4meds/2997192345/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">thankgod4meds</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/27/happy-thanksgiving-from-nashvillest/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Thanksgiving From Nashvillest!\">Happy Thanksgiving From Nashvillest!</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
