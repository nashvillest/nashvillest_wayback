Or when they&#x2019;re centered around alcohol. Hey, don&#x2019;t wag your fingers at us&#x2026; We know you love it too (one of our most popular posts ever was <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/23/bring-on-the-beer-new-belgium-beers-now-sold-in-tennessee/\" target=\"_blank\">beer-centric</a>), so we thought we&#x2019;d let you know about a couple things happening this weekend that provide the perfect excuse to throw back a few. Have a merry, boozy weekend.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://yazoobrew.blogspot.com/2008/09/yazoo-turns-five.html\" target=\"_blank\">YAZOO BREWERY&#x2019;S 5TH BIRTHDAY PARTY</a></strong></p>\n<p>Yazoo invites everyone to join them at the brewery on Saturday for their 5th birthday bash from 2pm until &#x201C;late.&#x201D; Live music begins at 8pm and South Street restaurant will be on site to fry up some catfish. And let&#x2019;s not forget the beer. They&#x2019;ve whipped up a handful of new beers for the occasion: Rye Saison, Wet Hop Harvest Ale, and we&#x2019;ve heard rumors of a couple more. We fully expect our friends at <a href=\"http://beerschoolblog.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Beer School Blog</a> to give us lowdown on the beers, but why not experience them firsthand?</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.beerandbourbon.com/nashville/show-info\" target=\"_blank\">BEER, BOURBON &amp; BBQ FESTIVAL</a></strong></p>\n<p>It doesn&#x2019;t get much better than this, right? Saturday from noon until 6pm, the Municipal Auditorium will be home to scores of beer, bourbon and BBQ vendors, all ready to fill your handy souvenir glass on demand. Everything but the BBQ is included in the $30 admission price &#x2013; Not a shabby deal for over 60 beer samples and over 40 bourbon samples.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/21/this-weekend-music-city-brewers-festival/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Music City Brewer&#x2019;s Festival\">This Weekend: Music City Brewer&#x2019;s Festival</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
