They&#x2019;ve finally put the draft up for public review, but if you want the hard copy you&#x2019;ll have to head to the downtown branch of the Nashville Public Library. For the technology-literate among us, you can find the <a href=\"http://www.civicinc.com/MetroStratPlan/ProposedUpdatesSPSB_5-30-2008.pdf\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.civicinc.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">PDF version</a> over here. If you&#x2019;re dying to see what your neighborhood is going to look like, it gets a little more complicated; fortunately the <em>Tennessean</em> has provided us with a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080610/NEWS02/80609089/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">lengthy list of steps</a> for doing just that. And finally, if you&#x2019;ve got something to say about it once you&#x2019;ve checked it out, you can email the Powers That Be at <a href=\"mailto:info@nashvilleplan.com\">info@nashvilleplan.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The strategic plan for bikeways and sidewalks is part of the larger <a href=\"http://www.planofnashville.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.planofnashville.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Plan of Nashville</a> that addresses most aspects of what the city is going to look like in the next few years. We&#x2019;d recommend checking it out, but not until after you&#x2019;d had your coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/09/bright-early-the-plan-is-to-have-a-plan-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The Plan Is To Have A Plan Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The Plan Is To Have A Plan Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
