We hate to start off the week with such a downer, but we want to give our Sounds some love after the <em>Tennessean</em> had a ball coming up with pitiful headlines about them this weekend (See <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080614/SPORTS0401/80614027/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Sounds lose to Iowa in empty stadium</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080615/SPORTS0401/806150383/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Only Sounds of silence play at empty park</a>). The guys lost the 5-4 heartbreaker in Iowa in front of a crowd of mostly baseball scouts and media because the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/06/13/midwest.flooding.ap/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">rest of the state is underwater</a> and everyone&#x2019;s been evacuated. So no, the stadium wasn&#x2019;t empty, and Nashvillest is giving the Sounds the benefit of the doubt by saying that they only let the Cubs win because Iowans need something to smile about these days. Our hearts really do go out to the state of Iowa (you can <a href=\"http://www.iowaflood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">donate here</a>), and also to the Sounds who <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesounds.com/stats/default.asp?stats=l_sta\" target=\"_blank\">can&#x2019;t seem to catch a break </a>this season.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cooling off.</strong> It&#x2019;s been a hot couple of days, but once we weather the storms this afternoon, we&#x2019;re looking at some blessed relief in the way of a <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2008/06/15/pm-tstorms-on-monday-then-a-big-breath-of-fresh-air/\" target=\"_blank\">cold front</a> that should cool things off by about 10-15 degrees. We don&#x2019;t know about you, but we can&#x2019;t wait.</li>\n<li><strong>Wave of the future.</strong> Metro&#x2019;s tossing around the idea of adding a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080614/NEWS0202/806140361/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">light rail or high-speed buses</a> to combat our problem with gas prices, though they make the observation that &#x201C;funding is key,&#x201D; which we read as, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t hold your breath.&#x201D; Speaking of!
