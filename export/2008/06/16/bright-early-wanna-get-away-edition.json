We hear it&#x2019;s been a rough road for our favorite former Director of Schools Pedro Garcia ever since the city ran him out earlier this year, but we didn&#x2019;t know <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8510949\" target=\"_blank\">it was this bad</a>: He&#x2019;s having such a hard time selling is $1.2M Brentwood mansion that he&#x2019;s now throwing a pair of round-trip Southwest tickets and some box seats at the Hollywood Bowl into the deal. We&#x2019;re not sure how far this would go in bribing someone who&#x2019;s already dropping over a million bucks on a house, but we wish him the best of luck with that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The scene is not safe.</strong> Just in case you thought we&#x2019;d seen the last of the killer tomatoes, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8510890\" target=\"_blank\">another salmonella case</a> was confirmed yesterday in Shelby County. This is the fourth known case in Tennessee after two were found in Williamson County last week and another in Rutherford.</li>\n<li><strong>Who will revive the electric car? </strong>Sen. Lamar Alexander was in town yesterday for a forum with state lawmakers and auto manufacturers to talk about the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/automotive/16618916/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">future of hybrid electric plug-in cars</a>. We were a little upset that we weren&#x2019;t invited, but then we remembered that we could still <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/09/better-than-therapy-lamar-is-listening/\" target=\"_blank\">drop him an email</a> about how much better our lives would be if we save ourselves a few hundred dollars by just plugging in our car.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Tullahoma has to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8500041\" target=\"_blank\">cancel</a> the July 4th fireworks show they&#x2019;ve been having since 1969. There&#x2019;s always room for you all in Nashville! &#x2026; Spring Hill is one step closer to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8501071\" target=\"_blank\">bringing back</a> the property tax &#x2026; Five years after a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080617/COUNTY090101/806170308/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">shark bite</a>, a Brentwood teen still loves to swim &#x2026; Vandy researcher receives <a href=\"http://outandaboutnewspaper.com/article.php?id=2693\" target=\"_blank\">$2.4M grant</a> to research HIV &#x2026; There&#x2019;s a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080617/GREEN02/806170368/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">dilapidated nuclear plant</a> on the Tennessee-Alabama border and TVA&#x2019;s not fixing it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/finleyreed/2575429023/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">dwneese</a>.</em></p>"
