Last July, we sent 120 members of the Tennessee National Guard off to Iraq. They&#x2019;re <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8522159\" target=\"_blank\">finally coming home</a> on Sunday, and we couldn&#x2019;t be happier to have them back. This is the same group that did another Iraq stint in 2003 and also helped clean things up on the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. They&#x2019;ll be arriving stateside tomorrow and actually getting back to the motherland on Sunday. Nashvillest sends them all a big thanks and a big welcome home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Good news for the old folks</strong>. Gov. Bredesen attended the signing ceremony yesterday for a bill that lets seniors to use TennCare money to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8521176\" target=\"_blank\">receive care at home</a> instead of having to move to an assisted living or nursing home. Bredesen noted that it&#x2019;s something &#x201C;that is going to improve the day-to-day lives of senior and disabled citizens in the days ahead.&#x201D;</li>\n<li><strong>In the zone</strong>. The school board is really happy about the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/16646070/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">extra $23M</a> written into the new budget for them, but they&#x2019;re still fighting some <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=60922\" target=\"_blank\">big zoning problems</a>. Namely, they&#x2019;re talking about sending all the JT Moore Middle School kids into Hume-Fogg Magnet School for high school. Predictably, it isn&#x2019;t going over well with the Hume-Fogg parents.</li>\n<li><strong>Bus route cancellations</strong>. Despite the $1M of funding cleared for MTA, they&#x2019;ll still have to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080619/NEWS0202/806190379/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">cut five routes</a>, according to the <em>Tennesssean</em>: Route 1 Vine Hill, Route 13 Sylvan Park, Route 16 Madison/Old Hickory, Route 31X Harpeth Valley Express, Route 45X Oak Hill Express and Night Owl service.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
