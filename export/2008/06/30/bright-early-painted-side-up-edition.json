Over the weekend, singer Bobby Brown had a rough time of it while he was filming his new CMT reality show <em><a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2008/06/bobby-brown-mau.html\" target=\"_blank\">Outsider&#x2019;s Inn</a> </em>in East Tennessee. Brown was involved in a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080628/HEADLINES/80628011/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">minor car crash</a> on Saturday and luckily made it out unscathed. We hadn&#x2019;t heard about the show before, but apparently Brown is helping Marcia Brady take over the East Tennessee bed &amp; breakfast <a href=\"http://www.christopherplace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Place</a>. We&#x2019;re not sure we needed a <em>Gone Country</em> reunion, but we&#x2019;re glad Bobby&#x2019;s okay.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Birds! </strong>Middle Tennesseans are facing an invasion of Chimney Swifts, which are small birds that live in your chimney and make a whole lot of noise. WTVF describes them as &#x201C;fast and sneaky&#x201D; and &#x201C;feathery intruders,&#x201D; but don&#x2019;t make the mistake of killing them&#x2013;destroying a nest, an egg, or a bird could set you back $10K in fines.</li>\n<li><strong>Hug a Metro.</strong> While Spain was off winning the 2008 European Championship yesterday, our own soccer team couldn&#x2019;t seem to <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=61132\" target=\"_blank\">pull together a win</a> for us. The <a href=\"http://www.nashvillemetrossoccer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Metros</a>, who are now 2-10, lost to the Cary Railhawks twice this weekend and set a new franchise record for the number of shutouts in a season&#x2013;currently at 7.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Some <a href=\"http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080627/NEWS02/806270423/1009\" target=\"_blank\">radioactive waste</a> could be rolling through sometime this year via the interstate &#x2026; Church of Scientology <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=61143\" target=\"_blank\">moves</a> from Music Row to $6M building on 8th Ave. &#x2026; Happy late anniversary to two of our favorite Nashville celebs, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080627/TUNEIN02/80627087/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Keith Urban &amp; Nicole Kidman</a> &#x2026; Southern Baptist Convention is the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080630/NEWS0202/806300353/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">first to book</a> the new Music City Center for its annual meetings in 2013 and 2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinur/2612574800/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Dinur</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/12/happy-hour-keep-the-painted-side-up/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Keep The Painted Side Up\">Happy Hour: Keep The Painted Side Up</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
