We try to look on the bright side.</p>\n<p><strong>Bright side #1</strong>: We made the list at #49 (out of 60).<br>\n<strong> Bright side #2</strong>: We topped the list with the highest percent increase in tech-related wages at 10% (and came in 48th for the average value of our high-tech paychecks).<br>\n<strong> Bright side #3</strong>: We created 100 new tech jobs for the year of the report, 2006 (but Seattle slaughtered us from the top of the list with 7,800 new tech jobs - we came in 49th).</p>\n<p>That 10% average wage increase in 2006 left us trailing only 20% behind the national average. Not such great news, but at least we&#x2019;re getting paid.</p>\n<p><em>Photo source <a href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/who/emotions/anger/2569794_portrait_of_a_robot.php?id=2569794\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/who/emotions/anger/2569794_portrait_of_a_robot.php?id=2569794&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </em></p>"
