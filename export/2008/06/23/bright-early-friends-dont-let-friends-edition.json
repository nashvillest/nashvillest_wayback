We hope you enjoyed the weekend cool-down as much as we did, even if you happened to miss the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/19/urban-pranksters-dive-in-theater/\" target=\"_blank\">June Freeze</a>. It was a rough weekend for the DUI&#x2019;s, though, as both Sounds&#x2019; outfielder <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8536747\" target=\"_blank\">Laynce Nix</a> and Titans&#x2019; defensive end <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8537075\" target=\"_blank\">Jevon &#x201C;The Freak&#x201D; Kearse</a> were arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. We&#x2019;re guessing no one told them about <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/nashvillest-spotlight-zingo-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">Zingo</a>. Either way, our hats are off to Metro for doing their best to keep our streets safe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rallying together.</strong> Residents of the quiet Hermitage subdivision Providence are <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080623/NEWS01/806230345/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">coming together</a> to fight against a proposed ministry and housing complex for men being released from prison. The complex would house 40 ex-cons about 10 miles away from the subdivision, and the residents are citing safety and property values as their main concerns.</li>\n<li><strong>We&#x2019;ve got high hopes.</strong> Mayor Dean has thrown together a new committee that hopes to come up with ways to make Nashville the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=60988\" target=\"_blank\">greenest city</a> in the Southeast, and maybe someday the US, even though we&#x2019;re usually rolling in behind Huntsville and Charlotte. It&#x2019;s a tall order, but we&#x2019;re hoping for the best. The efforts would place a lot of focus on cleaning up the water systems and the Cumberland since more than 16 million tons of sewage are dumped into it every year. Did someone say we should <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/13/department-of-bad-ideas-lets-go-for-a-swim/\" target=\"_blank\">go for a swim</a>?</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> &#x201C;Seven Words You Can Never Say on TV&#x201D; comedian George Carlin, 71, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/entertainment/16681733/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">died of heart failure</a> on Sunday &#x2026; Former Miss Scenic City Ellen Carrington was crowned as the <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8538533\" target=\"_blank\">new Miss Tennessee</a> this weekend &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8533129\" target=\"_blank\">The Boss</a> brings his show to the Sommet Center August 21st &#x2026; Recently-returned <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8536635\" target=\"_blank\">Iraqi War vet</a> drowns in Maury County.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaimee/2597271858/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">ms. roboto</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/20/bright-early-we-blame-stagflation-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: We Blame Stagflation Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: We Blame Stagflation Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/11/bright-early-friends-in-need-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Friends In Need Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Friends In Need Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
