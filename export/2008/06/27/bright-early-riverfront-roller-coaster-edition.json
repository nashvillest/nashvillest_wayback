We all sort of scratched our heads when Metro decided to install this weird-looking piece of public art down by the riverfront last year. As it were, the <em>Ghost Ballet for the East Bank Machineworks</em> sculpture was one of the 45 pieces of public art <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=61114\" target=\"_blank\">recognized as outstanding</a> by the group Americans for the Arts. We&#x2019;re guessing it still won&#x2019;t stop the tourists from pausing and asking us, &#x201C;Why is there a roller coaster by the river?&#x201D; Sigh.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Horsing around.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8563236\" target=\"_blank\">Two new horses</a> have been added to the Hendersonville Police Department. Regarding his new horse, Officer Nathan West tells WTVF, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s my partner. He is. He&#x2019;s been taking care of me and I&#x2019;ve been taking care of him.&#x201D; Too much cute for this early in the morning, right?</li>\n<li><strong>Ballin&#x2019;.</strong> Congrats to Shan Foster, Vanderbilt forward, who&#x2019;s been drafted <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080626/SPORTS0602/80626156/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">by the Dallas Mavericks</a> as their 51st pick for the NBA draft.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> More talk about Wilson County <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080627/COUNTY10/806270417/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Bible Park</a> &#x2026; A creepy guy is broke into an apartment on Woodlawn Drive and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8564354\" target=\"_blank\">fondled some girl</a> in her sleep, and police have a sketch &#x2026; Oil prices <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/16725525/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">shoot past $142</a> per gallon &#x2026; Cool Springs may get <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080626/COUNTY09/80626019/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">600 new jobs</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/edwindonnelly/2518206555/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">edwin.donnelly</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/02/shan-foster-is-really-really-happy-to-be-in-the-nba/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Shan Foster Is Really, Really Happy To Be In The NBA\">Shan Foster Is Really, Really Happy To Be In The NBA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/08/bright-early-duke-it-out-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Duke It Out Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Duke It Out Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
