The state held a series of town hall meetings yesterday for state employees to talk about the buyout offers they&#x2019;ve been mailing out over the past week. Trouble is, one really knows what went on because they <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080624/NEWS02/80624091/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">wouldn&#x2019;t allow the media or the public</a> into them. As of now, about 2,300 state employees are looking at accepting buyout offers or being laid off.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Boots strapped.</strong> After five multi-million dollar lawsuits were filed against him in the past month, Boots <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080625/SPORTS02/806250399/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">owes a total</a> of about $88M to creditors, which is $35M more than he actually has. Let that be a lesson, kids.</li>\n<li><strong>Powering down.</strong> More Nashvillians are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8551621\" target=\"_blank\">going without power</a> because they can&#x2019;t afford to pay their electric bills. About a third of low-income households haven&#x2019;t paid the full amount or haven&#x2019;t paid at all, and about 1 in 5 moderate-income households. NES has been consistently shutting off electricity to 400 homes per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
