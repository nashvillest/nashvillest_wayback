As soon as he stepped onstage with his glittery guitar and trademark &#x2018;stache, we knew we were in for a long afternoon. For being the one country musician that Nashvillians love to hate, he doesn&#x2019;t seem to be getting any less popular.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ll just try to forget that we saw him desecrate a half-dozen Johnny Cash classics and only remember the part where John McCain totally impressed us.</p>\n<p>For more photos from this afternoon&#x2019;s event, check them out over <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/scribebytrade/sets/72157605403753303/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/scribebytrade/2545884817/\" target=\"_blank\">nashvillest</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/01/raisin-mccain-john-rich-approves-this-message/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Raisin&#x2019; McCain: John Rich Approves This Message\">Raisin&#x2019; McCain: John Rich Approves This Message</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/15/storytime-raisin-mccain-explained-john-rich/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Storytime: &#x2018;Raisin&#x2019; McCain&#x2019; Explained [John Rich]\">Storytime: &#x2018;Raisin&#x2019; McCain&#x2019; Explained [John Rich]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/23/john-rich-is-all-up-in-our-christmas-parade-john-rich/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: John Rich Is All Up In Our Christmas Parade [John Rich]\">John Rich Is All Up In Our Christmas Parade [John Rich]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/12/john-rich-to-maybe-run-for-governor-in-2010-cmapocalypse/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: John Rich To Maybe Run For Governor In 2010 [CMApocalypse]\">John Rich To Maybe Run For Governor In 2010 [CMApocalypse]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/03/raisin-mccain-at-the-belmont-mansion-john-rich/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Raisin&#x2019; McCain At The Belmont Mansion [John Rich]\">Raisin&#x2019; McCain At The Belmont Mansion [John Rich]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
