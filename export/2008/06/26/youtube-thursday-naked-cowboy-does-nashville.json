Trekking all the way from New York City, the Naked Cowboy hit the streets of Nashville this year for the CMA Music Festival to attract every bad mullet within a 5-mile radius of downtown. The good news is that his entire visit was trimmed down to a 10-minute Youtube episode packed full of awkward moments for your viewing pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
