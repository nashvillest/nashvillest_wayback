It&#x2019;s been a rough road for the Fab Five, who have faced nothing but controversy since they hatched the idea back in October. The latest in the saga comes to us from the <em>Tennessean</em>, who published a <a href=\"http://data.tennessean.com/v2/bin/pluckTools/display/groupblog.php?blog=1eb5ccf4-a610-45ba-95e1-058eb45067c0&amp;plckController=Blog&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a1eb5ccf4-a610-45ba-95e1-058eb45067c0Post%3a91a239bc-9bc0-451f-acf9-a150c5b7ee31&amp;sid=sitelife.tennessean.com\" target=\"_blank\">colorful email exchange</a> yesterday between swim captain/Councilwoman <a href=\"http://www.nashville.gov/council/council23.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Evans</a> and swimteam archenemy/Councilman-at-Large <a href=\"http://www.nashville.gov/council/councilal3.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie Tygard</a>. In his letter, Tygard basically outlines every reason why the thinks taking a dip in the Cumberland is a terrible idea, and then Evans does her best to defend herself against his &#x201C;ceaseless quest&#x201D; to start fights on the Metro Council. We&#x2019;re guessing it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before they <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=8436330&amp;nav=menu374_1\" target=\"_blank\">pull a Mount Pleasant</a>, but in the mean time we&#x2019;re reminded of why we love city politics. And we don&#x2019;t know about you guys, but no one could pay us a large enough sum of money to paddle ourselves across the river.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/1uk3/2236883179/\" target=\"_blank\">1uk3</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
