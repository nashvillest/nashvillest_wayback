On July 18, teams of amateur (and some not-so-amateur) filmmakers will embark on a two-day adventure, probably completely unaware of the insanity that awaits them. Nashvillest participated two years ago, and let&#x2019;s just say we took last year off to recover.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The 48 Hour Film Project is a wild and sleepless weekend in which you and  a team make a movie&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D;write, shoot, edit and score it&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D;in  just 48 hours.  On Friday night, you get a character, a prop, a line of  dialogue and a genre, all to include in your movie.  48 hours later, the  movie must be complete.  Then it will show at a local theater, usually in  the next week.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The showings have been at the Belcourt in the past. It&#x2019;s a lot of fun, so if you think you&#x2019;re up for it, let us know. We might be looking to join a team again this year.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/midlakemarion/198084593/in/set-72157594211823674/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">midlakemarion</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/11/thats-a-wrap-48-hour-film-project-screenings-start-tonight/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: That&#x2019;s A Wrap: 48 Hour Film Project Screenings Start Tonight\">That&#x2019;s A Wrap: 48 Hour Film Project Screenings Start Tonight</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/12/48-hour-film-project-2009-registration-now-open/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: 48 Hour Film Project: 2009 Registration Now Open\">48 Hour Film Project: 2009 Registration Now Open</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/29/tonight-48-hour-film-project-screenings-at-the-belcourt/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: 48 Hour Film Project Screenings At The Belcourt\">Tonight: 48 Hour Film Project Screenings At The Belcourt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/23/a-foodie-film-buffs-paradise-food-on-film-week/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: A Foodie Film Buff&#x2019;s Paradise: Food On Film Week\">A Foodie Film Buff&#x2019;s Paradise: Food On Film Week</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/20/nashville-film-festival-2009-500-days-of-summer-review-guest-posts/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Film Festival 2009: 500 Days Of Summer Review [Guest Posts]\">Nashville Film Festival 2009: 500 Days Of Summer Review [Guest Posts]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
