The ethnic groceries and delicious food stands compliment what seems to be a mile-long stretch of fresh produce and greenery. It&#x2019;s a fun outing on a lazy weekend, or a great place to grab a bite to eat when you&#x2019;re in the area. But we were surprised when we found out about all the events that happen at the Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market year round - Crafting, cookouts, celebrations and more.</p>\n<p>June 21: Chefs At The Market<br>\nJuly 5: Meet Your Farmer<br>\nJuly 19: Chefs At The Market, Summer Grill Party<br>\nAugust 16: Market House Grand Opening Celebration<br>\nSeptember 15-21: Buy Local Week<br>\nOctober 18: Fall Harvest Festival<br>\nNovember 15: Turnip Green Festival<br>\nNovember 29-December 30: Holiday Market</p>\n<p>Every 3rd Saturday through August, there&#x2019;s also live music in the Market Midway. Nothing like a little local music to make outdoor produce shopping in the heat more bearable, we say.</p>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/sbluerock/611617765/\" target=\"_blank\">sbluerock</a>.</p>"
