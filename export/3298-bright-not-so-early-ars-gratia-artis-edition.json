This morning, we&#x2019;re giving thanks for our city&#x2019;s public art, which Councilman Charlie Tygard <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/councilman-commission-odds-over-public-art\" target=\"_blank\">has declared that he would like to spread around to the rest of Nashville by filing an ordinance with the Metro Council</a>. This sentiment isn&#x2019;t sitting well with members of the Metro Arts Commission who insist that they&#x2019;re already trying to do that and the ordinance would actually slow them down. We definitely won&#x2019;t argue that Nashville&#x2019;s public art&#x2013;which includes <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/crudbud/3868506899/\" target=\"_blank\">some polar bears having a snowball fight</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/28736120@N08/3459243435/\" target=\"_blank\">sculpture that everyone mistakes for a roller coaster</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallingwater123/3581621003/\" target=\"_blank\">infamous naked people</a> on Music Row, and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jettloe/3642215072/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Donelson</span> Dickerson Pike&#x2019;s new herd of buffalo</a>&#x2013;could use some work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GM plant idles</strong>. The<a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11570712\" target=\"_blank\"> Spring Hill GM plant officially goes idle today</a> meaning that around 3,000 folks who had jobs yesterday do not have those jobs today. Here&#x2019;s hoping that someone can figure out a way to help that situation.</li>\n<li><strong>Extreme BNA makeover. </strong>All of that dynamiting and traffic rerouting and interstate exit-closing around the airport has supposedly paid off with <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11571560\" target=\"_blank\">all of the changes BNA has rolled out for the holidays</a> including some new waiting areas and parking lots. We&#x2019;re most excited about <a href=\"http://www.freeholidaywifi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google&#x2019;s free holiday wifi</a>, though. Happy travels!</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Looks like we&#x2019;re in for <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2009/11/25/sunshine-today-clouds-tomorrow/\" target=\"_blank\">a cloudy-ish Thanksgiving</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11570717\" target=\"_blank\">Miley Cyrus is descending upon the Sommet Center tonight</a>, so you best steer clear of the area &#x2026; <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/11/24/no-press-allowed-to-see-palin-speech-at-the-opryland-tea-party-convention/\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Palin is banning the press</a> from her Tea Party speech at Opryland in February &#x2026; East Nashville probably won&#x2019;t be getting that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091125/COLUMNIST0128/911250377/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">traffic light they&#x2019;ve been hoping for</a> any time soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/crudbud/3868506899/\" target=\"_blank\">Phillip Riggins</a>.</em></p>"
