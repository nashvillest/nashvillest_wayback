But don&#x2019;t jump in the car and head out to do your shopping just yet &#x2013; Many businesses (not to mention homes) are still under water, and water levels are still rising in parts of the city, especially in downtown Nashville. If you don&#x2019;t absolutely have to be somewhere, it&#x2019;s still a good idea to stay at home. We&#x2019;re starting a running list of businesses closed due to flooding here, and if you have something to add, drop us a comment!</p><p><strong>Closed Monday, May 3:</strong></p><p><strong>NASHVILLE</strong></p><p>*Downtown from 1st-3th Avenues has been evacuated.<br>*Metro Center is still closed from last night&#x2019;s evacuation.</p><p>3rd &amp; Lindsley<br>Bates Nursery &#x2013; <em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/BatesNursery/status/13293498827\" target=\"_blank\">closed through May 6th</a></em><br>BB King&#x2019;s Blues Club &amp; Restaurant &#x2013; <em>Closed until further notice</em><br>Big River Grill &amp; Brewing Works &#x2013; <em>Closed until further notice</em><br>Bike Pedlar (Old Hickory Blvd)<br>Calypso Cafe (Belle Meade)<br>Centerstone (Metrocenter) &#x2013; <em>Patients diverted to Ransom Place office.
