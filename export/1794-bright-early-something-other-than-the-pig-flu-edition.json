We&#x2019;re probably almost as sick of reading/hearing about the swine flu as you are, so as our gift to you on this Friday, we mined and dug until we found a small handful of stories that actually don&#x2019;t mention it:</p><ul><li><strong>Don&#x2019;t ever let us go, Sully.</strong> We&#x2019;re mighty proud of <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/sullivan-named-finalist-nhls-masterton-trophy\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Sullivan, who&#x2019;s in the running for the NHL&#x2019;s Masterton trophy</a>&#x2013;an award given to the player showing the most perseverance in hockey. Sully&#x2019;s back injury kept him out of commission for nearly two years before he <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/02/04/happy-hour-sully-of-steel/\" target=\"_blank\">returned to the ice this past February</a>.</li><li><strong>Sign us up.</strong> The other day, we learned that the TVA was thinking about scraping up all the toxic sludge in Kingston and dumping it in some other part of Roane County. They&#x2019;re now also considering <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10285475\" target=\"_blank\">spreading it over to Cumberland County</a>.</li><li><strong>District 18 election results.</strong> The District 18 Showdown of Doom for Keith Durbin&#x2019;s old Metro Council seat is finally over, and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090430/NEWS02/90430088/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Kristine LaLonde won by a landslide</a> (or actually just&#xA0; 672 &#x2013; 476).</li><li><strong>Childcare help on the way.</strong> The State of Tennessee has about <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10282613\" target=\"_blank\">$42 million set aside to help out working families who are having a tough time affording childcare</a>. Recipient families will be nominated by their childcare provider and each licensed provider gets a certain number of scholarships to dole out depending on the size of the center.</li><li><strong>Because it&#x2019;s Friday.</strong> And finally, an unrelated <a href=\"http://cuteanimals.todaysbigthing.com/2009/04/20\" target=\"_blank\">adorable video of a weird animal getting tickled</a>.</li></ul><p>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/neuski/3470168994/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">neuski</a>.</p>"}
