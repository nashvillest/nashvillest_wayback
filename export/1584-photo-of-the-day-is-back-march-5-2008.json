We loved the way you guys were able to capture parts of the city we&#x2019;d never seen before, and we loved showcasing the ridiculous amount of talent (like today&#x2019;s pick&#x2013;a beautiful skyline capture by <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/04/photo-of-the-day-the-village-idiot-caption-contest/\" target=\"_blank\">edwin.donnelly</a>)&#xA0; we have here in Music City. Submissions slowed down, though, and we put the feature on hiatus. But the good news is that we&#x2019;re bringing it back!</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Interested in submitting? Head over to the Flickr and start tossing your best photos into <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/nashvillest\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">the pool</a>.
