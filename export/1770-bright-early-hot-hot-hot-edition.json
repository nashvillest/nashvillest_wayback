Congratulations to all of our friends who are way more athletic than we are and completed the Country Music Marathon or 1/2 marathon on Saturday. For the full list of runners and times, <a href=\"http://data.tennessean.com/DB/marathon/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">check out the Tennessean&#x2019;s massive marathon database</a>. Unfortunately the race didn&#x2019;t go by without some casualties; 25-year old Benjamin &#x201C;Levi&#x201D; Pigman, Ft. Campbell soldier and veteran of both Afghanistan and Iraq, collapsed and died at the end of the course. More than 50 other folks were taken to area hospitals for heat-related injuries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"articleflex-container\">\n<div class=\"articleflex\"><script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--\ntriggerAd(1,PaginationPage,11);\n// --></script> <script src=\"http://gannett.gcion.com/addyn/3.0/5111.1/133600/0/0/ADTECH;alias=RSS05article_ArticleFlex_1;cookie=info;loc=100;target=_blank;grp=644452;misc=1240841385750\"></script><strong>Oh noes. </strong>&#x201C;Not far away, a tiny girl in a pink top started  gnawing on a severed leg.&#x201D; &#x2013; Hundreds of folks <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090427/NEWS01/904270327/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">dressed up like zombies and filmed that movie in Smyrna</a> that <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/14/zombie-call-in-smyrna-for-indie-monster-flick/\" target=\"_blank\">we were talking about a few weeks ago</a>.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=\"articleflex-container\">\n<div class=\"articleflex\"><strong>Yawn. </strong>Soon we will all get to stop seeing those Stephenie Dodson and Kristine LaLonde, which have been up for at least four months.
