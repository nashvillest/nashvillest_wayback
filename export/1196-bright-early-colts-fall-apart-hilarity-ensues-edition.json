What a game, right!? We were afraid the winning streak was over there for a while, but then the Titans rallied from behind in the second half and defeated the Colts 31-21. And if there was any doubt, we definitely heard the <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">heavy artillery</span> fireworks that went off outside almost immediately after the clock hit zero. Heck, all of Middle Tennessee probably heard them. But let&#x2019;s face it&#x2013;<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081027/SPORTS01/81027080\" target=\"_blank\">a 7-0 record is probably worth celebrating</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More layoffs.</strong> As part of an effort to cut costs (and 5,000 jobs), Whirlpool will be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081028/BUSINESS01/81028008/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">closing its plant in Jackson, TN</a>, which should do wonders for our October unemployment rate. Jackson has been hit hard. Overall, Jackson has been hit a little harder than the rest of the state by the recession with close to a 9% unemployment rate during the month of September.</li>\n<li><strong>Bells, TN shocked by report.</strong> Speaking of West Tennessee, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/politics/17819546/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">the town of Bells is reeling</a> at yesterday&#x2019;s news that a Bells native was planning a killing spree and an assassination of Senator Obama.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> When the economy is down for the count, the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081028/COLUMNIST0101/810280358/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">scammers</a> tend to come out of the woodwork &#x2026; We&#x2019;re sure everyone&#x2019;s waiting with bated breath to see the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=63726\" target=\"_blank\">state report card</a>, which comes out November 10th &#x2026; Larry McGehee, former chancellor at UT Martin, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9248838\" target=\"_blank\">passed away</a> on Saturday.</li>\n</ul>"
