Every year, we swear we&#x2019;ll be partying in style&#x2026; next year. Then, when next year rolls around, we find ourselves in the same place &#x2013; On the couch. Now, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with settling in for a quiet night at home, but if you&#x2019;re looking for something to do and just can&#x2019;t seem to find anything fun, Nashville&#x2019;s got you covered. Here are (just a few) of our suggestions for being out &amp; about tomorrow night.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.visitmusiccity.com/newyearseve/?utm_source=DMC&amp;utm_medium=EMAIL&amp;utm_content=nashvillest@gmail.com&amp;utm_campaign=3127:Harmony123009\" target=\"_blank\">Music City&#x2019;s Bash on Broadway (with Guitar Drop)</a></strong>,&#xA0;<em>7:30pm, 1st &amp; Broadway, free</em>. After a failed attempt at unloading $250 concert tickets for last year&#x2019;s NYE celebration, the Nashville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau is throwing this year&#x2019;s party for free. This time, they&#x2019;ve put together a lineup of music for the night including Rodney Atkins, Jonny Lang, Tommy Sims, Marc Broussard, the Dirt Drifters, and Gabe Dixon. And our city is so rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll that we&#x2019;re dropping a guitar at midnight (instead of a lame glittery ball), then shooting off some fireworks because that&#x2019;s how we roll. We&#x2019;ll be hooking you up with road closures in a separate post, so stay tuned!</p><p><strong>Dine in style</strong>. Enjoy a low-key, fancy-shmancy meal with some champagne and other little perks, depending on where you decide to drop your dollar. <a href=\"https://app.e2ma.net/app/view:CampaignPublic/id:2226.2717222038/rid:a6fd92ce3a32eed603693397ffe8a2aa\" target=\"_blank\">Downtown Details</a> has the scoop on fixed-price evenings at Capitol Grille, Sambuca, Prime 108, The Melting Pot, Nashville City Club, Flyte, Sole Mio and Merchant&#x2019;s, and the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillescene.com/promotions/viewEmailByDistLstDelivId/16059\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Scene</a> has the deets for dinner at Sperry&#x2019;s, The Wine Loft, Urban Flats and more.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=509245\" target=\"_blank\">12th &amp; Porter&#x2019;s 2nd Annual New Years Big Ass Bash</a></strong>. <em>7pm doors/9pm show, $20-$40, 18+</em>.<br>If you click that little link right above, you&#x2019;ll be able to score $20 tickets to 12th &amp; Porter&#x2019;s NYE bash.
