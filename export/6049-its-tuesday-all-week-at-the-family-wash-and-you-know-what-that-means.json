Pints! It&#x2019;s 8am and our bellies are already rumbling at the mere mention of <a href=\"http://www.familywash.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.familywash.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">the Family Wash</a>&#x2018;s Pie &amp; Pint night. Usually a Tuesday-only treat, Pie &amp; Pint night at the Family Wash nets you a famous shepherd&#x2019;s pie and a frosty pint of beer for just $10 (a pie by itself is regularly priced at $11). And to celebrate the 10th birthday of Shortsets, the Wash&#x2019;s weekly songwriter night, the bargain pies &amp; pints will be available every night this week (November 16-20)!</p><p>Shortsets is celebrating its tenth birthday with a full week of &#x201C;short&#x201D; sets at the Family Wash, starting tonight. The nightly&#xA0;Shortsets performances each night will feature founder Cole Slivka and her husband Paul, plus three showcase artists, totaling 20 sets from 16 artists over the course of the week. The final act each night will perform a full-band set, and because this is Nashville, you just never know who might show up. Accompanied by a full week of Pie &amp; Pint nights, we&#x2019;re pretty sure there&#x2019;s nowhere else we&#x2019;d rather fuel up this week!</p><p><strong>Tuesday, November 16</strong>: Cole &amp; Paul Slivka, Warren Pash, Joe Pagetta, Josh Bennett<br><strong>Wednesday, November 17</strong>: Cole &amp; Paul Slivka, Gwil Owen, Kevin Gordon, The Mike &amp; Mark Show<br><strong>Thursday, November 18</strong>: Cole &amp; Paul Slivka, TBA, Erik Dail, The Magnificent Others<br><strong>Friday, November 19</strong>: Cole &amp; Paul Slivka, Colleen McFarland, Richard Douglas, Reeves Gabrels<br><strong>Saturday, November 20</strong>: Cole &amp; Paul Slivka, TBA, Tom Mason, Tommy Womack</p><p>The Family Wash opens at 6pm, and Shortsets starts at 8pm.
