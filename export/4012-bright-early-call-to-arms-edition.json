We hope you guys were able to get outside this weekend and enjoy a taste of spring <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/02/winter-returns/\" target=\"_blank\">before temperatures start plummeting this afternoon</a>. In other news, the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AJ55H20091120\" target=\"_blank\">number of handgun permits issued by the State of Tennessee have jumped 23% from this time last year</a>, possibly because we keep thinking we&#x2019;re going to be able to tote them into new places, like restaurants and bars. For those keeping score, the controversial &#x201C;guns in bars&#x201D; measure, which passed last June before being struck down by a judge in November for being too vague, <a href=\"http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/jan/14/let-courts-decide-revisiting-guns--bars-tennessee-/\" target=\"_blank\">is still floating around in the court system awaiting re-visitation</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enjoy it while it lasts.</strong> Gas prices are noticeably lower these days, but AAA says that we shouldn&#x2019;t expect it to last too much longer. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100222/BUSINESS01/2220314/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Experts predict that it&#x2019;ll hit $3 per gallon over the summer.</a></li>\n<li><strong>Polar Plunge success.</strong> The 11th annual <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/polar-bear-plunge-breaks-records?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Polar Bear Plunge at Percy Priest was a record success, raising $35,000 for the Special Olympics</a>. It should be noted that it reached a very un-polar 66 degrees on Saturday (though the water was supposedly still 38 degrees, so we&#x2019;ll give &#x2019;em that.)</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The spokesman for the Fairgrounds Heritage Preservation Group is a <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/fairgrounds-activist-associated-convicted-sex-offender\" target=\"_blank\">registered sex offender living with a convicted pedophile as recently as 2005</a> &#x2026; Nashville is <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/good-times-bad-times?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">undertaking its largest anti-poverty effort in the history of the city</a> &#x2026; Lots of Middle Tennessee parents are outraged over an American Idol contestant who <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100222/ENTERTAINMENT06/2220336/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">allegedly scammed a lot of families out of a lot of money</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallingwater123/4375119335/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">fallingwater123</a>.</em></p>"
