This weekend is full of Saint Patty&#x2019;s fun&#x2026; and most importantly, beer. We&#x2019;ll be back with a special Tuesday roundup of more St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day events, but get a head start by filling up on green beer at F&#xE9;ile Franklin this Saturday.</p>\n<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thegoon.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Goon 10th Anniversary Party</strong></a>. <em>Cannery Ballroom, 7pm</em>. We don&#x2019;t know much about The Goon, but we do know that Calabrese, Ghoultown and The Protomen are playing, which is good enough for us. Plus, we hear that there will be all sorts of surprises and special appearances. Tickets are $10.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ticketbiscuit.com/exitin/EventPage.aspx?EID=26447&amp;VD=3/1/2009&amp;\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>King Khan &amp; The Shrines with Golden Triangles and The Deep Vibration</strong></a>. <em>Exit/In, 9pm</em>. We&#x2019;ve heard lots about the amazing live show that King Khan &amp; the Shrines put on, and we&#x2019;re kind of bummed that we can&#x2019;t make it out to this one. But if you can make it, then we&#x2019;d love to live vicariously through you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/experience-events-detail.aspx?cid=3994\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nashville Opera presents Mozart&#x2019;s <em>The Magic Flute</em></strong></a>. <em>Country Music Hall Of Fame, 2pm, FREE</em>!
