We&#x2019;re pretty sure we could hear the Preds fans screaming all over city on Saturday after the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=66463\" target=\"_blank\">epic 8-0 win over the Detroit Red Wings</a>. It was a night of firsts for our Preds: First win by 8 goals, first time they&#x2019;ve scored 5 goals in the first period (including the first 4 in 5:03, which is the fastest of any home game), and the last 3 goals in 1:24&#x2013;also the fastest of any home game. And we can&#x2019;t forget <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=66481\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Arnott, who scored the goals #5, #6, and #8</a> for the Preds&#x2019; first hat trick of the year. Clearly they were feeling pretty good on Saturday night (see the above photo wherein Shea Weber tries to rip off the head of some unfortunate Red Wing) and we hope, hope, <em>hope </em>they can keep it up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Doin&#x2019; it wrong.</strong> Stories that start out like this make Monday morning almost tolerable: &#x201C;Some drunks got out of hand near Beale Street in Memphis, but instead of  barflies it was <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/26900fa2-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">birds intoxicated from eating fermented fruit.</a>&#x201C;</li>\n<li><strong>New VA project. </strong>Meharry Medical College will be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090301/BUSINESS01/903010358/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">partnering again with the Department of Veterans Affairs</a> to open a new clinic focused on the care of 2,000 female veterans.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Lt.
