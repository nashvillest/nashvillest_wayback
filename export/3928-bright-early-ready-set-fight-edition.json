Metro school officials are <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11960157\" target=\"_self\">kicking around a couple of ideas for making up the last snow day, which was not actually a snow day because they&#x2019;re out of those</a>. For some reason, just every other school system in the midstate builds in anywhere from 10-12 snow days and they all seem to be handling things just fine, but Metro has already used their allotted five and then some. Consequently, Metro is looking at shortening Spring Break, tacking days onto the end of the year and making several half-days into full days. We imagine that none of these options will please the kiddos, but what can you do?</p><ul><li><strong>Doesn&#x2019;t grow on trees.</strong> It seems like we read different versions of this story every other week, but <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11961093\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee&#x2019;s unemployment fund is still running out of money</a>.
