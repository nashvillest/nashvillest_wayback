Whether you&#x2019;re running the marathon or heading out to cheer someone on, you&#x2019;ll probably get caught up in some pretty nasty traffic if you don&#x2019;t know where to go. We&#x2019;ve got the full list of road closures as well as some additional resources here to keep you in the clear. And good luck to our running readers!</p><p><strong>Resources</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=208418134277265304707.00049c7f6997bdfcaf088&amp;ll=36.157509,-86.775054&amp;spn=0.087157,0.097248\" target=\"_blank\">Country Music Marathon Road Closures Interactive Map</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nashvillemta.org/PDFHomePage/1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville MTA Detour Schedule</a> (PDF alert!)<br><a href=\"http://nashville.competitor.com/files/2009/05/No-Parking-Grid-CMM-4-1-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">No Parking Zones</a> (PDF alert!)</p><p><strong>Road Closures:</strong></p><p><em>Closing Wednesday, Thursday &amp;
