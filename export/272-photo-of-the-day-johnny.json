After all, Nashville wouldn&#x2019;t be Nashville without the people (and canines) that live here. Though we&#x2019;ve all probably experienced that special kind of road rage from getting stuck behind a horse-drawn carriage downtown, we can&#x2019;t help but love them. And we <em>really</em> can&#x2019;t help but love <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/98007314@N00/1424458339/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Douglas</a>&#x2018; capture of this guy and his dog who are just moseyin&#x2019; along and well, being <em>Nashville</em>.</p><p><strong>Just a reminder:</strong> We&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;ve come across some great photos in the pool that we can&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t use due to privacy settings that keep us from downloading or linking them.
