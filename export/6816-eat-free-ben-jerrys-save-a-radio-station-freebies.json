It&#x2019;s a big job, but somebody&#x2019;s gotta do it.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.benjerry.com/scoop-shops/feature/free-cone-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s annual Free Cone Day</a> is coming up on April 12, and this year the beneficiary of Free Cone Day at the 21st Ave Nashville location is the WRVU Friends &amp; Family Association. (Who knew that there was&#xA0;a beneficiary of Free Cone Day? Not us.) WRVU&#x2019;s DJs will also be on hand to chat and sell you some sweet Save WRVU merchandise. Stop by anytime from 12-8pm, wait in a super-long-but-super-fast-moving line, gobble down your free ice cream and donate a little of the cash you saved on the ice cream to help save WRVU.</p>\n<p><em>If you&#x2019;re in the dark on what exactly WRVU is and why it needs saving, head over to </em><a href=\"http://www.SaveWRVU.org\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SaveWRVU.org</em></a><em> to learn more about it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Free Cone Day, April 12, 12-8pm</strong>.</p>"
