This news will be music to your ears &#x2013; We&#x2019;ve just learned that&#xA0;<a href=\"http://grimeys.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grimey&#x2019;s</a> is saving the day yet again, hosting the boys from across the pond for a free in-store performance on Monday, November 1 at 6pm.</p>\n<p>This probably goes without saying, but we&#x2019;ll say it anyway: Get there early! Unless you&#x2019;re a brand-new Nashvillian, you know that Grimey&#x2019;s is tiny, and an in-store like this will fill up quickly. We&#x2019;re big Mumford &amp; Sons fans here at Nashvillest, so we&#x2019;ll be staking out spots in line along with the best of you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mumford &amp; Sons in-store at Grimey&#x2019;s, Monday November 1 at 6pm.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #1: </strong>Grimey&#x2019;s has released some additional information about next week&#x2019;s in-store. The gist of it is this: Performance time has been updated to 6pm, and it&#x2019;s only <em>mostly</em> free &#x2013; You have to head to Grimey&#x2019;s this week and buy a copy of <em>Sigh No More</em>, the band&#x2019;s debut record on CD or vinyl. But you&#x2019;ll get a limited edition poster for free with your purchase, and if you already own the record you can give it away for Christmas. Win-win!</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #2: </strong>As of 4pm Monday,&#xA0;Grimey&#x2019;s is at capacity for the in-store. If you didn&#x2019;t get a chance to secure your spot today, it looks like you&#x2019;re going to have to start bribing your friends who did.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thequeenshall/4438058547/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Queen&#x2019;s Hall</em></a><em>.</em></span></strong></p>"
