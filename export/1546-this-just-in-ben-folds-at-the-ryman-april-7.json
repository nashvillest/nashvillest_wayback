The <a href=\"http://www.visitmusiccity.com/music/newreleases?utm_medium=micro-blog&amp;utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Convention &amp; Visitor&#x2019;s Bureau</a> announced the April 7 show today on their <a href=\"http://twitter.com/visitmusiccity\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter account</a>, and tickets will be going on sale next Friday, February 27. The date isn&#x2019;t on The Ryman&#x2019;s site, nor is it on Ticketmaster, so we suppose that Visit Music City could be leading us wrong&#x2026; But for the love of all things holy, we sure hope not.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll report back when we learn more about ticket prices and if there will be a presale or not. 2009 is shaping up to be a great year at The Ryman (and look! They&#x2019;ve <a href=\"http://twitter.com/theryman\" target=\"_blank\">discovered Twitter</a> too)!</p><p>UPDATE 2/19: Show confirmed by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TheRyman/status/1230964247\" target=\"_blank\">The Ryman</a>. Lightning 100 will have an internet presale. Stay tuned to their <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Lightning100/status/1230610682\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>/<a href=\"http://lightning100.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> for more details.</p>"}
