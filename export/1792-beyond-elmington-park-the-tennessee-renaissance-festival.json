The Tennessee Renaissance Festival marks the beginning of summer, festival season, and all things good &amp; right in the world (at least for some folks), and we&#x2019;ve heard so much hype that we can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;ve never made it out to Arrington for the festivities. Each weekend in May boasts a theme; this weekend is Opening Weekend Family Celebration, while weekends to come include Romance Weekend, Pirate Invasion and International Jousting Tourney. Between the shows and the swordfights and the jesting and the juggling, the Ren Fest has enough to keep anyone occupied.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><span>Travel back to 16th Century England! Enjoy the colorful pageantry of costumed villagers, artisan and musicians, laugh with merry entertainers, and cheer for your favorite knight in a full armoured joust. Castle Gwynn, a full size replica of a twelfth century border castle, welcomes festival-goers to tour the 1st floor and castle grounds. The Rose-Dan Freeman Weaponery Collection will be on display at the castle along with a portrait of Queen Elizabeth I. Come share the music, thrill at exciting stage presentations and jousting events, watch the Birds of the Gauntlet, amd much more at festive Covington Glen&#x2026; great entertainment for all ages and a must-see for the entire family.</span></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, we can&#x2019;t pass this up. Plus, we hear they have <em>awesome </em>food.&#xA0;The Tennessee Renaissance Festival takes place from 10am-6pm every Saturday and Sunday in May, and <a href=\"https://vs2.korax.net/~blaupunk/tnrenfest/ticketForm.php\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/vs2.korax.net&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">tickets</a> are $16 regular price for adults.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnlamb/2519941032/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>johnlamb</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/16/the-ren-fest-isnt-over-till-the-pirates-invade/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Ren Fest Isn&#x2019;t Over &#x2018;Till The Pirates Invade\">The Ren Fest Isn&#x2019;t Over &#x2018;Till The Pirates Invade</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/13/go-green-this-weekend-at-the-nashville-earth-day-festival/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Go Green This Weekend At The Nashville Earth Day Festival\">Go Green This Weekend At The Nashville Earth Day Festival</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
