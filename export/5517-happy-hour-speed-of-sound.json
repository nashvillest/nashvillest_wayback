We&#x2019;ve heard this story before, but it sounds like they&#x2019;ve already secured $14 MILLION in federal funding for the project. The contractor is looking to grab another $34 million to get the job done a little faster. It&#x2019;ll likely stretch between Atlanta and &#x2018;Noog first before being extended to Nashville and Louisville, KY.
