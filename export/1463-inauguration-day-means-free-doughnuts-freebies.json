J/K!!!1 Bring on that starch.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Krispy Kreme Doughnuts&#x2019; Inauguration Day promotion on Tuesday, January 20, 2009, is offering one, free doughnut of a customer&#x2019;s choice at participating Krispy Kreme locations nationwide. No purchase is necessary. The promotion allows customers to commemorate Inauguration Day by selecting one free doughnut of any variety at local participating stores. On Election Day, November 4, 2008, Krispy Kreme ran a promotion that provided customers with one free star-shaped doughnut at stores nationwide. The Inauguration Day promotion is not about any social or political issue.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/27302612@N03/3015527214/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>marc.benton</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/06/national-doughnut-day-where-no-one-really-gives-away-anything/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: National Doughnut Day: Where No One Really Gives Away Anything\">National Doughnut Day: Where No One Really Gives Away Anything</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/04/more-reasons-to-vote-free-ice-cream-from-ben-jerrys-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Reasons To Vote: Free Treats All Over [Freebies]\">More Reasons To Vote: Free Treats All Over [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/04/15/wipe-away-the-tax-day-blues-with-free-stuff-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Wipe Away The Tax Day Blues With Free Stuff [Freebies]\">Wipe Away The Tax Day Blues With Free Stuff [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/20/collect-those-free-cosmetics-nashville-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Collect Those Free Cosmetics, Nashville [Freebies]\">Collect Those Free Cosmetics, Nashville [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/04/have-some-fun-this-labor-day-weekend-with-free-bowling-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Have Some Fun This Labor Day Weekend With Free Bowling [Freebies]\">Have Some Fun This Labor Day Weekend With Free Bowling [Freebies]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
