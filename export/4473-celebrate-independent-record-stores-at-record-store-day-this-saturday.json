Record Store Day is this Saturday, and things are probably going to get a little wild at the indie record store of your choosing. <a href=\"http://www.recordstoreday.com/Page/836\" target=\"_blank\">Exclusive releases</a>, live music, lots of beer, food and discount music are the typical highlights of the day, and this year is no different. Though it seems that Grimey&#x2019;s learned from last year&#x2019;s Avett-Brothers-and-Mute-Math-induced-pandemonium and booked some lower-key entertainment this year, the live music lineups across the board are solid&#x2026; and free.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://thegroovenashville.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Groove</a></strong>:<br>\n10:00  Store opens to public</p>\n<p><em>Outside Live Music:<br>\n</em> 12:00  Daniel Pujol<br>\n1:00   Illnana<br>\n1:50   Danger &amp; The Steel Cut Oats<br>\n2:45   Emmylou Harris<br>\n3:15   The Grayces<br>\n4:15   Chris Crofton<br>\n5:15   The Distribution<br>\n6:15   Outlaw Lovers<br>\n7:10   Hans Condor</p>\n<p><em>Inside Live Music:<br>\n</em> 8:00  Tristen<br>\n8:50  Tallest Trees<br>\n<strong><a href=\"http://grimeys.com/\" target=\"_blank\"></a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://grimeys.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grimey&#x2019;s</a></strong>:<br>\n10am &#x2013; Store opens to the public<br>\n11am &#x2013; DJB (guest DJ)<br>\n12noon &#x2013; How Cozy (Southern Girls R&#x2019;n&#x2019;R band)<br>\n12:30 &#x2013; SKiPP (guest DJ)<br>\n1pm &#x2013; Bows &amp; Arrows (great local band releasing exclusive 7&#x2033; for RSD)<br>\n1:30 &#x2013; D-Funk (guest DJ)<br>\n2pm &#x2013; The Coolin&#x2019; System (killer organ-fueled soul jazz w/ horns and a new 7&#x2033;)<br>\n2:30 &#x2013; DJ Jack (guest DJ)<br>\n3pm &#x2013; Alex Chilton Tribute (Eef from Clem Snide and Grimey have an awesome tribute to our fallen hero in store for you from the Box Tops to Big Star)<br>\n3:30 &#x2013; DJ C Havighurst (guest DJ from WSM muso-journo/Music City Roots)<br>\n4pm &#x2013; John Cowan (brand new album The Massenburg Sessions out now)<br>\n4:30 &#x2013; Nashville&#x2019;s Dead (guest bloggers DJ set)<br>\n5pm &#x2013; Daniel Pujol (fast-breaking Infinity Cat artist w/ exclusive RSD 7&#x2033;)<br>\n5:30 &#x2013; Pimp Daddy Supreme (need I say more?)<br>\n6pm &#x2013; American Bang (releasing exclusive RSD 7&#x2033; w/ new album on Warners due soon)<br>\n6:30 &#x2013; DJ SRC (guest DJ)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/news.html\" target=\"_blank\">Third Man Records</a><br>\n</strong> 12-2: Shop is open to buy your copper colored BBS record and any other sweet vinyl and novelties&#x2026;<br>\n2:15 &#x2013; 2:45: Raffle and Auction<br>\n3:00: Racontwoers (two members of the Raconteurs reunite) perform live in the Third Man venue, get your Black and Blue ticket after the show in the shop!</p>\n<p>The Groove is also giving away a guitar autographed by Emmylou Harris, among other things, and offering 15% off all new items and 25% off all used items during the day.
