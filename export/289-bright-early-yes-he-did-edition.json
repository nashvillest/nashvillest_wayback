It was a big night in politics last night, as Barack Obama pretty much clenched the Democratic <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.democrats/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">nomination</a> and became the first black man to ever do that. We say &#x201C;pretty much&#x201D; because everyone seems to be acknowledging it except Hillary. Even McCain spoke of her in the past tense which didn&#x2019;t really surprise us after he left her out of his presentation entirely at the Ryman on Monday. Anyway, rest assured that <a href=\"http://tndp.org/thedonkeysmouth/?p=243\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee Democrats are hanging out</a> at <a href=\"http://www.swettsrestaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Swett&#x2019;s Restaurant</a> at this very moment listening to Governor Bredesen&#x2019;s sure-to-be-interesting lecture on party unity. We wonder if they&#x2019;re handing out <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2008/06/02/who-was-that-masked-man/\" target=\"_blank\">those creepy Bush masks</a> there, too.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Passing the hat.</strong> In the spirit of election coverage, our favorite blogging state lawmaker <a href=\"http://www.legislature.state.tn.us/house/members/h18.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Stacey &#x201C;The Rep&#x201D; Campfield</a> has resorted to ye olde <a href=\"http://lastcar.blogspot.com/2008/06/time-to-pass-hat.html\" target=\"_blank\">internet panhandle</a> since he isn&#x2019;t accepting PAC or corporate donations right now. So if you&#x2019;d like to contribute to his campaign, you can head over to his blog and, you know, Paypal it.</li>\n<li><strong>Accident at &#x2018;Montana&#x2019; filming.</strong> An <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/entertainment/16481661/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">accident</a> on the Hannah Montana set sent a projection screen barreling into a group of extras on a ferris wheel in Rutherford County. We&#x2019;re glad to hear no one was hurt, but we&#x2019;re guessing the footage won&#x2019;t be making it onto the gag reel.</li>\n<li><strong>As MTA turns.</strong> We&#x2019;ve talked a little bit about the city cutting 7 of the least-trafficked bus routes. Last night at the City Council meeting, many of Nashville&#x2019;s residents <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080603/NEWS02/80603145/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">fought back</a>, pleading with council members not to eliminate the routes that are some people&#x2019;s only form of transportation.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>More <a href=\"http://sylvanpark.blogspot.com/2008/06/coyotes-spotted-on-53rd-and-54th.html\" target=\"_blank\">coyote sightings</a> in Sylvan Park &#x2026; Murfreesboro residents <a href=\"http://www.murfreesborotn.gov/government/water_sewer/water_sewer_index.htm\" target=\"_self\">may see a rise</a> in water and sewage costs &#x2026; We&#x2019;re way excited to report that Hummers might soon be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080603/BUSINESS01/80603006/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">on their way out</a> &#x2026; In case you haven&#x2019;t noticed, it&#x2019;s supposed to be really <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2008/06/03/well-be-complaining-about-the-heat-humidity-this-week/\" target=\"_blank\">hot and humid</a> this week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/midnightquill/2218389078/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniella Zalcman</a>.</em></p>"
