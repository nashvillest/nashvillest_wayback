Turns out that JWOWW will even spray lucky conference attendees with her new JWOWW Continuous Sunless Spray! We&#x2019;re not sure how you could pass that up. Castmate Pauly D also has a new indoor tanning solution that will be represented at the conference, but sadly, he won&#x2019;t be in attendance.</p>\n<p>It wouldn&#x2019;t be the Jersey Shore without a lot of alcohol in a grimy club, and Snooki and JWOWW are taking care of that by hosting separate private parties downtown on Saturday night. They&#x2019;re exclusive to conference attendees and you have to stop by their respective booths at the trade show to snag an invite, but be our guest if you want to figure out a way to weasel in. And the rest of you? Consider yourselves warned.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/10/17/bless-your-heart-the-ladies-of-the-jersey-shore-talk-nashville-tanning-tim-mcgraw-interviews/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bless Your Heart: The Ladies Of The Jersey Shore Talk Nashville, Tanning &amp; Tim McGraw [Interviews]\">Bless Your Heart: The Ladies Of The Jersey Shore Talk Nashville, Tanning &amp; Tim McGraw [Interviews]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/10/suit-up-santa-rampage-spreading-christmas-jeer-this-saturday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Suit Up: Santa Rampage Spreading Christmas Jeer This Saturday\">Suit Up: Santa Rampage Spreading Christmas Jeer This Saturday</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
