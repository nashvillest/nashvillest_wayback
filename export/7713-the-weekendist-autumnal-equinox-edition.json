There&#x2019;s plenty to do on this first-official-weekend-of-fall, so don&#x2019;t miss out. We&#x2019;ll be running around from Soundland venue to Soundland venue (more on that later), but we&#x2019;re crossing our fingers for a break in the weekend&#x2019;s schedule to hit up some of the many delightful events in town this weekend. Here are our top picks:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilleaidswalk.com/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=483198\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvilleaidswalk.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville AIDS Walk &amp; 5k</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, September 24 at Riverfront Park, 10am checkin, 11am start, $25 to run, free to walk</em>. This year marks the 20th annual Nashville AIDS Walk &amp; 5k run benefitting Nashville Cares. We&#x2019;re big fans of this event, mostly for the good cause, but we won&#x2019;t lie &#x2013; we&#x2019;re also partial to the fact that it doesn&#x2019;t start at 7am like every other 5k in town. Walk to show your support, or register for the 5k and enjoy an early afternoon race. After the walk, stick around for a concert featuring&#xA0;Trial By Fire, Black Market Research, Finess, Billy Swayze and Kimberley Locke.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Dog-of-Nashville/54614178302\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The Dog of Nashville&#x2019;s 3rd Annual Sausage Fest</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, September 24 from 2-8pm at The Dog of Nashville, $15 for all-you-can-eat</em>. Really, what more could you ever want to do with your weekend than attend a Sausage Fest at the local hot dog eatery? Yeah, we thought so.&#xA0;The following types of, ahem, <em>exotic</em> sausage will be present: Venison with blueberry and gator, rabbit, cajun, brazilian, ostrich, wild boar with cranberry, plain ol venison, lamb. Plus beef brisket sandwiches, pork spare ribs, elk chili and more! So in addition to an entire zoo&#x2019;s worth of sausage, there will be wrestling. Live wrestling and sausages. A match made in heaven.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/23/free-frist-more-this-saturday-for-smithsonian-magazine-museum-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Magazine Museum Day</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, September 24, various times at various locations, free</em>. <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/23/free-frist-more-this-saturday-for-smithsonian-magazine-museum-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Clicky your way on over here</a>, where we wrote all about Smithsonian Magazine Museum Day earlier today.

If you haven&#x2019;t been keeping up with the Soundland festivities thus far, the don&#x2019;t-miss event of the weekend is happening all day Saturday in Germantown. <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/12/soundland-2011-gets-started-next-week-so-why-not-give-away-some-free-wristbands/\" target=\"_blank\">Remember that NINJASAUR slide we mentioned a couple times</a>? You&#x2019;ll find that here, plus a 30 foot waterside (YES!) and a killer lineup of music spanning 7+ hours that includes JEFF the Brotherhood, Those Darlins, The Black Belles, Tristen, The Apache Relay, Jessica Lea Mayfield and the Royal Bangs. Oh, and did we mention food trucks (or is that just a given)? And seriously, the NINJASAUR. If you didn&#x2019;t take our advice and get yourself a festival wristband, you can get a ticket for the Saturday&#x2019;s festivities (at the Neuhoff only) for $25.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://predators.nhl.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;predators.nhl.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Preds vs. Jets</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, September 24 at Bridgestone Arena, 7pm, ticket prices vary</em>.

We&#x2019;re hockey-starved after the off season, and can&#x2019;t wait to see the boys back out there this weekend.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/23/free-frist-more-this-saturday-for-smithsonian-magazine-museum-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Regions Free Day at Cheekwood</a></strong>. <em>Sunday, September 25 at Cheekwood, 11am-4:30pm, free</em>.&#xA0;&#xA0;We also wrote about free day at Cheekwood earlier today, so again, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/23/free-frist-more-this-saturday-for-smithsonian-magazine-museum-day/\" target=\"_blank\">click here for the deets</a>, then get out there and enjoy fall!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/grassyknollmovies\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Annie Hall</em> at Grassy Knoll Movie Nights</a></strong>. <em>Sunday, September 25 on the side lawn at Bongo Java East, 8pm, $5 adults/$1 kids</em>. The semi-monthly movie series is back with another classic, the cult favorite <em>Annie Hall</em>.
