A few months ago, we heard rumors of a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090826/NEWS03/908260398/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">proposed lawsuit between A&amp;E and House of Bryant, the company that currently owns the rights to our fair state&#x2019;s anthem &#x201C;Rocky Top.&#x201D;</a> In an episode of <em>City Confidential</em>, a true-crime show, producers decided to insert a 12-second clip from the song to make the point that they were in Knoxville. Problem is, they requested the rights for the song before using it and were turned down, but used it anyway. Now A&amp;E being sued by the children of the original songwriters for probably a lot of money. And most people think they&#x2019;re probably going to lose.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li><strong>More stimulus funds.</strong> Tennesssee is getting $188 million in new stimulus money to fix up public housing, but it <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090826/BUSINESS01/908260396/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">probably won&#x2019;t do much in the way of creating more affordable housing options</a>. Instead, it&#x2019;ll likely be going towards subsidizing rents at existing complexes that would&#x2019;ve been funded anyway.</li>\n<li><strong>Schools in trouble.</strong> Two local charter schools are on probation including Nashville Global Academy, which <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10989746\" target=\"_blank\">ran out of bus drivers and didn&#x2019;t drop students off after school until 9pm on the first week</a>. Metro is keeping an eye on Smithson Craighead Academy for test scores that don&#x2019;t meet No Child Left Behind benchmarks.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Tennesseans are getting more creative with their <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=10770\" target=\"_blank\">meth-baking techniques</a>, though few can top <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/03/happy-hour-things-we-wish-we-never-knew/\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> &#x2026; Another Metro elementary school was <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10989544\" target=\"_blank\">placed on lockdown</a> thanks to a nearby burglary &#x2026; In case you missed the Jonases and you&#x2019;re dying for some photos, <a href=\"http://nashville.metromix.com/events/photogallery/byrds-eye-view-jonas/1421280/content\" target=\"_blank\">you can find them here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/peppysis/3851730129/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Peppysis</a>.</em></p>"
