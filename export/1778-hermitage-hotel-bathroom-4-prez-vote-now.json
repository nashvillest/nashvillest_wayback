The Hermitage Hotel is clamoring to keep its prestigious title of &#x201C;America&#x2019;s Best Restroom,&#x201D; which <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/27/the-hermitage-hotel-keeps-it-classy/\" target=\"_blank\">they won last August</a>. And despite what you might have read today in <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/19310384/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">every</a> <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/WaterCooler/wireStory?id=7446134\" target=\"_blank\">news</a> <a href=\"http://sfchronicle.us/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2009/04/28/national/a040030D13.DTL\" target=\"_blank\">outlet</a> <a href=\"http://www.9news.com/news/watercooler/article.aspx?storyid=114647&amp;catid=337\" target=\"_blank\">ever</a> (thanks, AP!) they haven&#x2019;t actually won it for 2009 yet. That is why <a href=\"http://www.bestrestroom.com/vote.php\" target=\"_blank\">it is our civic duty to go vote</a> and make sure that Nashville and the Hermitage retain bathroom bragging rites for another year:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#x201C;From the architecture and room furnishings to exceptional customer service, The Hermitage Hotel has an uncompromising commitment to excellence,&#x201D; said Greg Sligh, Hermitage Hotel President and Managing Director. &#x201C;This philosophy defines everything in the hotel &#x2013; including our distinctive Art Deco men&#x2019;s room, which has long been known as Nashville&#x2019;s most unique and elegant restroom. It is an honor for this whimsically distinctive facility to be recognized nationally as well.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The men&#x2019;s restroom, located outside the Oak Bar on the hotel&#x2019;s lower level, maintains the 5-star elegance of the hotel, which was designed in 1910 to symbolize Nashville&#x2019;s emergence as a major Southern city. The Art Deco restroom, which was remodeled in 1930, features lime green and black leaded-glass tiles, lime green fixtures, an authentic terrazzo floor and a two-seat shoeshine station. Since that time, the restroom has been the setting for music videos, business and political negotiations, as well as, believe it or not, wedding photos.
