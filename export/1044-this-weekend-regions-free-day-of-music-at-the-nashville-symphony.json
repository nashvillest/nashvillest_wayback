This Saturday marks the 3rd year that the Nashville Symphony has graciously opened the doors of the new Schermerhorn Symphony Center and hosted a day of festivities and free, wonderful music. The first year, we waited in line for hours just to get in&#x2026; And it&#x2019;s really worth it. This year, passes will be handed out starting at 11am until they hit building capacity, and then the waiting starts. As people come and go, their passes are redistributed to those waiting in line.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The day is full of music from a variety of local groups, and the Nashville Symphony will perform (yes, for free) at 8:15pm. Beware if you&#x2019;re thinking of seizing the opportunity for a cheap date &#x2013; the symphony is, uh, low on vibeyness on free day, if you catch our drift. We&#x2019;re talking disposable cameras, crying babies and TONS of cowboy hats. But you get what you pay for, and it&#x2019;s a great introduction for those intimidated by the idea of a formal and expensive evening at the symphony.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The full schedule for Saturday is <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesymphony.org/res/080911DOMSchedule.pdf\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;download&apos;,&apos;www.nashvillesymphony.org/res/080911DOMSchedule.pdf&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/blueshoe/386124993/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jon Erickson</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/08/music-to-our-ears-free-symphony-day-returns-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Music To Our Ears: Free Symphony Day Returns [Freebies]\">Music To Our Ears: Free Symphony Day Returns [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/11/nashville-symphonys-free-regions-community-concerts-better-late-than-never/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Symphony&#x2019;s Free Regions Community Concerts [Better Late Than Never]\">Nashville Symphony&#x2019;s Free Regions Community Concerts [Better Late Than Never]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/28/nashville-symphony-presents-regions-community-concerts/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Symphony Presents: Regions Community Concerts\">Nashville Symphony Presents: Regions Community Concerts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/21/sounds-like-summer-nashville-symphony-to-host-free-community-concerts-once-again/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sounds Like Summer: Nashville Symphony To Host Free Community Concerts Once Again\">Sounds Like Summer: Nashville Symphony To Host Free Community Concerts Once Again</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/02/19/double-your-free-frist-center-pleasure-this-weekendfreebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Double Your Free Frist Center Pleasure This Weekend [Freebies]\">Double Your Free Frist Center Pleasure This Weekend [Freebies]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
