More than 50 artists, mostly local, fill the lineup for the ten-week series, and special guests can always be expected. Musicians Corner will run Saturdays 3-6pm from September 3 &#x2013; November 5. The focus is on the music, but the food trucks, kids activities and more make it a community event that shouldn&#x2019;t be missed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/live_on_the_green-logo.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7660 aligncenter\" title=\"live_on_the_green-logo\" src=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/live_on_the_green-logo-300x187.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\"></a></p>\n<p>Live On The Green returns for the 2011 season tonight with a stellar lineup &#x2013; Will Hoge, Chris Bailey and the Nashville Symphony with K.S. Rhoads. Thanks to the sudden cold front we&#x2019;re experiencing, things will get going a little earlier than usual tonight with the headliners taking the stage at 7pm.
