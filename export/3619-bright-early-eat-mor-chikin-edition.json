We hope everyone had a safe and uneventful commute this morning which <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11789301\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">may have included navigating around the overturned chicken nugget truck on I-65 in Madison</a>. It seems that when semis are not getting wedged beneath overpasses, they&#x2019;re spilling weird things all over the interstate. The accident happened early this morning and was likely due to the ice. Though we haven&#x2019;t seen any pictures yet, we&#x2019;re hearing reports that the frozen nuggets spilled out across three lanes. TDOT hopes to have everything cleaned up and reopened by noon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mr. Tim wouldn&#x2019;t have lied to us. </strong>Since most of us spent most of yesterday shaking our fists at the local weather forecasters, <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/01/my-kids-still-love-me/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/nashvillewx.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">we do appreciate this heartfelt apology from WKRN&#x2019;s Lisa Patton</a> for getting our hopes up and then crushing them.
