Since the initial conversations surrounding Metro&#x2019;s school rezoning plan last year, many folks have been voicing opposition and claiming that the changes will bring segregation back into the school system. For a long time, Metro has been busing kids from North Nashville into West Nashville and Bellevue to balance out the racial diversity in each school, but due to budget constraints, they&#x2019;ve ended the practice effective this year. The <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090901/NEWS04/909010337/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">NAACP is finally bringing a civil rights lawsuit against MNPS as they&#x2019;ve been talking about doing for months</a>. Their first plaintiff is a fifth grade student who was rezoned from Bellevue Middle School to John Early Middle School, which still doesn&#x2019;t have textbooks available after the first week of school. More plaintiffs are expected to come forward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Electric bills not changing, yet.</strong> Regardless of whatever you hear about the TVA&#x2019;s rates going up this month, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090901/NEWS0202/909010339/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">your electric bill shouldn&#x2019;t be changing</a>. Rates are going up, but fuel charges are coming down and the two will cancel each other out. Starting in November, they&#x2019;ll be reviewing fuel charges monthly rather than quarterly, though, so there will likely be some fluctuation.</li>\n<li><strong>Councilwoman in more trouble.</strong> East Nashville Councilwoman Pam Murray, whose constituents seem pretty determined to oust her these days, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/councilwoman-hit-another-ethics-complaint\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">is being accused of yet another ethics violation</a>. This time, the complaint concerns the use of Metro&#x2019;s money to send out fliers about a community meeting addressing the effort to kick her out of her council seat.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Mt.
