Why in the world would we want to do that? Well, apparently it&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080603/NEWS/80603109/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">in the running</a> to be America&#x2019;s Best Restroom of 2008. If you skipped the tour like we did and you&#x2019;re dying to know what could possibly warrant an award like that, head over to the <a href=\"http://www.bestrestroom.com/entry8.html\" target=\"_blank\">America&#x2019;s Best Restroom</a> site and take the virtual tour. You can also cast a vote if you&#x2019;re into that sort of thing. The winning restroom will get a plaque and a spot in the Best Restroom Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>And if that isn&#x2019;t reason enough to pay a visit to the Hermitage, they&#x2019;re <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/05/26/daily44.html\" target=\"_blank\">giving away gas cards</a> to everyone who books a stay there between June and September. And if you&#x2019;ve got one of those spiffy hybrids that make us really jealous, you can also get free valet parking.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/irisheyes/452046948/\" target=\"_blank\">irisheyes</a>.</em></p>"
