The only problem is that sometimes they&#x2019;re so busy that we can&#x2019;t even find a seat, which is not a bad problem to have for a brand new business. The remedy? Jarod and Courtney are answering consumer demand for increased hours, starting today! Ugly Mugs is now open on weekdays from 6am-10pm, on Saturday from 7am-10pm and Sunday from 7am-5pm. Finally, a coffee shop that&#x2019;s open past 8pm in East Nashville? Yes please!&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Now here&#x2019;s the free part (we know that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re still reading) &#x2013; we&#x2019;re proud to offer Nashvillest readers a special offer in celebration of Ugly Mugs&#x2019; extended hours. Simply print out the coupon above (click to open in a new window) and bring it in anytime this week for a sweet buy-1-get-1-free deal&#x2026; But you may want to wake up early and race your fellow readers to Ugly Mugs, because the first person to bring in the coupon each day this week will get coffee for themselves and a friend for <strong>FREE</strong>! Consider this an opportunity to try out a new coffee shop risk-free, or a little reward for those who have been supporters since day one.&#xA0;</p>"
