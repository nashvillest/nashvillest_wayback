One of the biggest challenges with renovating the riverfront has been figuring out what to do with that eyesore of a scrap metal yard near LP Field, PSC Metals. The yard has been there for long, long time&#x2013;so long, in fact, that it&#x2019;s actually exempt from a lot of current city codes. &#xA0;But because of the damage it sustained in the flood, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12557053\" target=\"_blank\">PSC might have to apply for new building permits that would require them to make some big changes like keeping the monstrous metal piles inside</a>. There&#x2019;s a possibility that it might even move. As Councilman Mike Jameson told WKRN, we love that it&#x2019;s a recycling plant and everything, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean it needs to sit on the river.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New home for Tent City.</strong> Tent City folks have <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=18077\" target=\"_blank\">set up a temporary camp out in Antioch with the help of some local churches</a> and will receive aid from FEMA to replace their lost shelters. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12557270\" target=\"_blank\">Many of their new neighbors are none too pleased about the relocation</a>, fearing a spike in crime.</li>\n<li><strong>We&#x2019;re open! </strong>Mayor Dean met with downtown merchants yesterday to emphasize the message that Nashville is open for business. So far, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/mayor-wants-everyone-know-we-re-back?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">all the businesses that flooded have opened back up except for the Wildhorse Saloon and Joe&#x2019;s Crab Shack</a>. Wildhorse is set to open next week.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong><a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/05/afternoon-storms-continue/\" target=\"_blank\">More storms this afternoon</a> &#x2026; Most of the midstate lakes and waterways will be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100528/NEWS01/5280343/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">back open for Memorial Day weekend</a> &#x2026; &#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=12557950\" target=\"_blank\">Gas prices are continuing to fall</a>, just in time for roadtrip season &#x2026; It took the Davidson County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office 11 days to figure out they&#x2019;d <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100528/NEWS03/5280345/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">accidentally released a murder suspect</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=12558086\" target=\"_blank\">A dispute over a proposed fish hatchery</a> is the entire reason we don&#x2019;t yet have a state budget for next year .</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dougclutter/288831237/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>weownthisdoug</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
