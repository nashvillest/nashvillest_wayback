And although there&#x2019;s no promises of a Bat Poet appearance (he showed up last year), we&#x2019;re still looking forward to it. Grimey&#x2019;s has lined up a solid list of performances, and you can count on the Yazoo beer &amp; BBQ showing up. The Avett Brothers and MuteMath are the big names playing this year, but it&#x2019;s all free anyway&#x2026; So check out a band or artist that you haven&#x2019;t heard before.</p><ul><li>12:00pm: The Avett Brothers</li><li>12:45pm: Stardeath &amp; White Dwarfs</li><li>1:45pm: Michigan City Vandals</li><li>2:30pm: DeRobert &amp; The Half-Truths</li><li>3:15pm: Black Joe Lewis &amp; The Honeybears</li><li>4:00pm: Charlie Louvin</li><li>4:45pm: Del McCoury</li><li>5:15pm: Royal Bangs</li><li>6:00pm: The Ettes</li><li>7:00pm: MuteMath</li></ul><p>In addition to the shows, Grimey&#x2019;s back lot is bound to be overflowing with discount music, and they&#x2019;ll be carrying a <a href=\"http://www.recordstoreday.com/NewsItem/1408\" target=\"_blank\">bunch of big releases</a> a few days early. Grimey&#x2019;s will be open from 10am-8pm on Saturday for Record Store Day.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kelstew/2359965673/\" target=\"_blank\">kelstew</a>. </em></p>"}
