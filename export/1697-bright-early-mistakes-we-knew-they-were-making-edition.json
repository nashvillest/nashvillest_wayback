We mentioned yesterday that the security contractor for Metro Nashville Public Schools <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10150626\" target=\"_blank\">accidentally leaked the names, birth dates, and social security numbers of more than 18,000 students and 6,000 parents onto the internet</a>. Oops! Last night, they sent out a sheepish email about the breach (view it <a href=\"http://i43.tinypic.com/2dhuq0h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> &#x2013; <em>Thanks to Jody S. for the tip!</em>) letting folks know that the contractor will be providing one year of identity theft protection. To put it into perspective, though, the Davidson County Election Commission misplaced 337,000 of our social security numbers back when they had their big data breach in 2007. So really, <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=67406\" target=\"_blank\">this is no biggie (&#x2026;)</a>!</p><ul><li><strong>New funds for infant mortality.</strong> Nashville is going to be the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090409/NEWS0201/904090359/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">lucky recipient of $483K to fight infant mortality around the city</a>.
