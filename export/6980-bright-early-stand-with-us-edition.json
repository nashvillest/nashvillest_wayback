We&#x2019;re still celebrating the Preds victory last night, in which <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14505316/preds-make-history-defeat-ducks-4-2\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">they defeated the Anaheim Ducks 4-2 to advance to the Western Conference semifinals for the first time in franchise history</a>. The real story, though, seems to be the <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14505503/smashville-fans-draw-national-attention\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">tens of thousands of very loud and very rowdy fans who turned out in droves and proved to the world that &#x201C;Nashville is becoming a really good hockey market.</a>&#x201D; Though the Preds are still waiting to find out who they&#x2019;ll take on for round 2, <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/search?tm_link=tm_homeA_header_search&amp;q=nashville+predators&amp;search.x=35&amp;search.y=8&amp;camefrom=CFC_PREDATORS_SPL\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketmaster.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">tickets are already on sale for three home games with dates to be announced as soon as the schedule is set</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rain rain rain to come down down down. </strong>Only about one week shy of the one year anniversary of the Nashville Flood, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14507032/rainy-week-for-tenn-10-inches-in-some-spots\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;up to 10 inches of rain&#x201D; is not what we like to see in the forecast for Tennessee this week</a>. At the moment, the midstate is looking at a little less than West Tennessee, but could still see 8 inches of rain in some areas in addition to severe weather.</li>\n<li><strong>Reconnecting with our whiskey heritage. </strong><a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110425/BUSINESS01/304250034/2275/rss05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee is stepping up its whiskey game with a boom of distilleries popping up all over the state, and they&#x2019;re hoping that the laws will keep up</a>. Much of the more restrictive legislation barring on-site tastings and sales at distilleries are left over from the Prohibition and distillers are hoping to have a little more luck with that than we&#x2019;ve had with the whole wine-in-grocery-stores issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/metro-state-initiate-southeasts-first-pill-disposal-program?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Metro and the State of Tennessee are initiating the southeast&#x2019;s very first pill disposal program</a> aimed at keeping pharmaceuticals out of the environment and water supply &#x2026; The United Methodist Church has <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/27656407/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">established a Flood Recovery Network to assist flood victims who still need help</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14506488/gops-haslam-marks-100-days-as-tenn-governor\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Governor Bill is looking back on his first 100 days as governor</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/weather/27658373/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">FEMA is starting to assess damage caused by the April 4th tornadoes</a> in 11 counties including Davidson.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/victorjames615/5647532783/in/pool-715021@N24/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Victor Guy</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
