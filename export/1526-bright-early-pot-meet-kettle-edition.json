The new coach at University of Tennessee is already in hot water for <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090210/SPORTS0601/902100317/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">using some illegal tactics to lure potential recruits</a> to the team including a staged mock press conference and&#x2026; a fog machine? Creative! The UT athletics department blew the whistle on Coach Kiffin and sent him a letter pointing out that he&#x2019;d violated the NCAA&#x2019;s policies. Unfortunately this wasn&#x2019;t the first time he&#x2019;s gone rogue either, since the SEC sent him another nasty letter last week for spreading a rumor about Florida&#x2019;s coach using illegal recruiting tactics.</p><ul><li><strong>State of the State.</strong> We expect to be hearing a lot about Governor Bredesen&#x2019;s State of the State address over the next couple of days.

Though they offered him his job back, he would have had to take a lower position and let&#x2019;s face it&#x2013;who really wants to work for Metro right now anyway?</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>There is a <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9815111\" target=\"_blank\">giant job fair</a> today at the fairgrounds for the 50,000 of you who are rocking the unemployment in Nashville &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090210/BUSINESS02/902100339/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville home sales</a> are the lowest they&#x2019;ve been in 15 years &#x2026; The number of <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/health/18676146/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">salmonella cases</a> in Tennessee is now up to 13 &#x2026; Pacman <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9816296\" target=\"_blank\">became a free agent</a> yesterday after Dallas decided they didn&#x2019;t want him either.</li></ul><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/silenus81/3261151644/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Silenus81</a>.</em></p>"}
