Your morning headlines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metro Schools officials polled parents and found that just over half of them actually prefer the idea of a &#x201C;balanced&#x201D; school calendar to the regular one. With the balanced calendar, kiddos would probably start in late July or early August and give up a couple of weeks of summer break in favor of longer fall and spring breaks.

Though Titans coach Mike Munchak let him off without any sort of punishment, he could be looking at some sort of disciplining measures from the league.

The fight landed the latter in the emergency room, but the officer on the scene couldn&#x2019;t tell who attacked whom first. They were both referred to the DA&#x2019;s office to press charges if they felt like it, but neither has done so yet.

Seriously, bring on the fall. We&#x2019;re over it.

Over the years, it&#x2019;s been used by music legends like Johnny Cash and Hank Williams to slip out during a show and grab a drink from one of the Broadway honkytonks.
