They call themselves <a href=\"http://www.teamgenius.biz\" target=\"_blank\">Team Genius</a>, and they do music videos, improv, and a Flight-of-the-Conchords-esque video series called <strong>Boy Friends</strong>. It makes us laugh, and we love recognizing the random places around Nashville that they film. <a href=\"http://www.teamgenius.biz/boyfriends/index.php?v=4\" target=\"_blank\">This one</a> is our favorite, and we think that anyone who has ever done a doubletake at the storefronts on Broadway will appreciate it.&#xA0;</p>"
