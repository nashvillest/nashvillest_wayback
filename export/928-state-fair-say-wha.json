The <a href=\"http://www.tennesseestatefair.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee State Fair</a> is back again. It sort of snuck up on us because no one seems to care about the Tennessee State Fair, but hey. It&#x2019;s our state, so let&#x2019;s at least pretend that we&#x2019;re excited. This year&#x2019;s state fair features sundry <a href=\"http://www.tennesseestatefair.org/TSFThingsToDo.htm\" target=\"_blank\">fair-esque things</a> such as cow milkin&#x2019; and tractor racin&#x2019; and hamburger eatin&#x2019; (Krystal hamburgers, no less). Tickets are $8, but you can pick up half price tickets at any Kroger. Rides and concessions will cost you an arm and a leg extra, but what&#x2019;s a state fair without emptying your pockets on cotton candy and ferris wheel rides? And also, the Tennessee State Fair would like to bring you this PSA:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.tennesseestatefair.org/2007TennesseeStateFair.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>If historic events were ranked like historic sites, the Tennessee State Fair would be very close to the top of the list!</em></a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay, we&#x2019;ll take their word on it.&#xA0;</p>"
