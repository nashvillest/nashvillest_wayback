Even if you&#x2019;ve never been into local theater, the <a href=\"http://tennesseerep.org/lookin.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;tennesseerep.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">free LookIns</a> are a great way to get your feet wet.</p>\n<p>A few weeks before each show, the Reps host these hour-long previews that feature remarks from the director, a special meet-and-greet with the show&#x2019;s cast, and an actual rehearsal scene from the show. Oh yeah, and there&#x2019;s free wine! Tonight&#x2019;s LookIn will give you a sneak peek at <a href=\"http://tennesseerep.org/moonlight.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;tennesseerep.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Moonlight &amp; Magnolias</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Set in 1939 Hollywood, <em>Moonlight and Magnolias</em> tells the story of what  could have happened when legendary producer David O. Selznick shut down  production of his new epic, <em>Gone with the Wind</em>. The screenplay, you  see, just isn&#x2019;t working &#x2026; Selznick sends a car for famed screenwriter Ben Hecht and pulls formidable  director Victor Fleming from the set of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. Summoning  both to his office, he locks the doors, closes the shades, and on a diet of  bananas and peanuts, the three men labor over five days to fashion a screenplay  that will become the blueprint for one of the most successful films of all time.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The LookIn is from 5:30-6:30 this evening NPT&#x2019;s Studio A (<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=161+rains+ave+nashville+tn&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=31.509065,56.601563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=36.135916,-86.764591&amp;spn=0.007833,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;maps.google.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">map</a>) across from the State Fairgrounds.
