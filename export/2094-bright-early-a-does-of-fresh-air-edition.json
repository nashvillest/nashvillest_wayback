A Southwest flight from Nashville to Baltimore <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10722166\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;a/www.wkrn.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">had a close call yesterday when the fuselage of the plane more or less sprang a leak</a>. A hole appeared in the cabin, about one foot by one foot, and passengers could actually see the sky. The plane was diverted to an airport in West Virginia until Southwest could bring in another plane. Fortunately no one was injured and one passenger had this to say:&#xA0; &#x201C;As soon as we touched down and got to the airport in West Virginia, everybody  cheered; everybody high fived the captain, some gave him hugs. But, a great  crew, great flight crew and great flight attendants. Everybody just did what  they were supposed to do.&#x201D; Yep, sounds like Southwest. Southwest spent the better part of the night performing inspections on the rest of the fleet.</p><ul><li><strong>Getting creative. </strong>A sports bar in Johnson City has a snarky answer to the new gun legislation, which goes into effect today: Give out pistols to patrons.
