The video for the single &#x201C;Good Time&#x201D; was filmed earlier this month in Dickson, and people came from as far as Oklahoma to dance in it. We&#x2019;re really disappointed we didn&#x2019;t hear about the casting call for this monumental feat, which Jackson told Channel 5 was &#x201C;the most challenging job I think I&#x2019;ve ever done in my career.&#x201D; Forget the record-breaking CMA nominations or the ten #1 country albums or even headlining Fruit of the Loom Country Comfort Tour in 1995. We hope it was worth it, but the jury&#x2019;s still out until we see the video.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/staynergirl/146926665/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">staynergirl</a>. </em></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/05/dierks-bentley-sends-out-an-sos-rhinestones-encouraged/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Dierks Bentley Sends Out An S.O.S.
