We did everything in our power to ward off that pesky swine flu, but it as of yesterday,<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090429/NEWS01/90429071/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>it made its way into Tennessee with a vengeance. And by &#x201C;vengeance&#x201D; we mean there is one case so far in Williamson County and the kid appears to be doing fine. Consequently, though, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090429/NEWS01/90429071/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">the victim&#x2019;s entire school&#x2013;Harding Academy&#x2013;will be closed for seven calendar days beginning today</a>. But before everyone starts panicking, take a few minutes to <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/04/090427-swine-flu-facts.html\" target=\"_blank\">read up on the swine flu</a>. And in case you&#x2019;re wondering, bacon is perfectly safe!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>OMGSCANDAL.</strong> News Channel 5 claims they&#x2019;ve undercovered a massive ticket fixing scandal where some folks in Davidson County may be <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10275093\" target=\"_blank\">having traffic tickets thrown out because their attorneys have special hookups</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Religious discrimination suit.</strong> Southern Hills Medical Center had to shell out $70,000 to <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/19325161/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">settle a religious discrimination lawsuit involving a Muslim employee</a> who wanted to take a pilgrimage to Mecca last year, saved up his vacation time, and then ended up losing his job instead. Southern Hills still denies they practiced any sort of discrimination.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Today is the culmination of that <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10277609\" target=\"_blank\">District 18 runoff/showdown between LaLonde and Dodson</a>, so if you live in that district, go vote or something &#x2026; Country legend Vern Gosdin, who we&#x2019;re a bit too young to remember, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10271820\" target=\"_blank\">passed away this week</a> at age 74 &#x2026; We may soon have to pay <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10278221\" target=\"_blank\">tax that automatically adjusts based on gas prices</a> ($4, anyone?) instead of the current per-gallon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brandonjames/2861192769/\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon James</a>.</em></p>"
