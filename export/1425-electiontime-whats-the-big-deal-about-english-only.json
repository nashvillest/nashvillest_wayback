Yard signs are popping up, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBxtUfIHp60&amp;eurl=http://www.nashvilleforallofus.org//About_files/widget1_markup.html\" target=\"_blank\">TV commercials</a> are airing during the evening news, folks are knocking on our doors, we&#x2019;re getting robocalls and emails from Mayor Dean, and it&#x2019;s all sort of overwhelming. And since this whole election thing has set us back $500K, we have to make sure we get our money&#x2019;s worth out of it by actually voting, right? Vote for it or vote against it, but <strong>go vote</strong>! A few links for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nashville English First.</strong> This is where it all began&#x2013;The <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleenglishfirst.com/\" target=\"_blank\">official website of the referendum</a> that gives you the full text of the proposed amendment along with a pretty comprehensive Q&amp;A about what it is. And some animated American flags flapping in the breeze.</li>\n<li><strong>Nashville For All Of Us.</strong> If you&#x2019;re looking for the other side of the story, <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleforallofus.org\" target=\"_blank\">this is it</a>. Be sure to check out the growing list of English Only opponents which includes everyone from the Chamber of Commerce to the Jewish Federation.</li>\n<li><strong>The Ad.</strong> In case you missed it, check out the full page ad in the <em>Tennessean</em> featuring a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081228/OPINION03/812280367/1009/NEWS01\" target=\"_blank\">letter signed by 8 college presidents</a> condemning the measure including Vanderbilt, Belmont, and Lipscomb universities.</li>\n<li><strong>The Letter.</strong> Even Mayor Dean has gotten in on the action (which seems to take a lot these days) by sending out <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillecityblogs.com/?p=799\" target=\"_blank\">this email</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Early voting runs through the 17th at Howard School downtown, and you can find the schedule <a href=\"http://www.nashville.gov/VOTE/schedule_early.htm\" target=\"_blank\">over here</a>. Or if you&#x2019;re like us and you don&#x2019;t feel like driving all the way down there, all the other polling spots will be open on Thursday, January 22nd. <a href=\"http://www.nashville.gov/vote/voterlookup/address-lookup.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Go here</a> to find out where you vote.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/eskimo_jo/1326619691/\" target=\"_blank\">eskimo_jo</a>.</em></p>"
