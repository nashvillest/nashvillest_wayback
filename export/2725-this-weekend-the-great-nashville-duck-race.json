Due to the river being much higher than usual, organizers decided it probably wouldn&#x2019;t be safe to have folks gathering near the riverfront. The winning ducks will be chosen on 9/22.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re feeling a bit like ducks already with the rainy weather this week, but the <a href=\"http://www.greatnashvilleduckrace.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.greatnashvilleduckrace.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Great Nashville Duck Race</a> is coming up tomorrow at the downtown riverfront, and we can&#x2019;t wait to watch 10,000 rubber ducks go racing away down the Cumberland. Now in its second year, the Great Nashville Duck Race is a fundraiser that benefits&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.bgcmt.org/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.bgcmt.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Middle Tennessee</a>, and was also the beneficiary of the most recent&#xA0;<a href=\"http://twestivalnashville.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;twestivalnashville.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Twestival Nashville</a>.</p>\n<p>Participants can &#x2018;adopt&#x2019; a duck (or multiple ducks) for $5, and the first ducks to cross the finish line will be awarded with some pretty crazy prizes. The grand prize? $10,000.00 cash.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s still time to adopt some ducks, so head over to <a href=\"http://www.duckrace.com/Default.aspx?alias=www.duckrace.com/nashville\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.duckrace.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">GreatNashvilleDuckRace.com</a> to throw your name in the hat and support a great cause. The fun starts tomorrow at 11am, and the ducks drop at 1pm. We&#x2019;ll be there cheering on our ducks from Twestival, and we&#x2019;d love to have Nashvillest readers join us.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/23/this-weekend-great-nashville-duck-race/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Great Nashville Duck Race\">This Weekend: Great Nashville Duck Race</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/10/dont-forget-twestival-nashville-tonight/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Forget: Twestival Nashville Tonight\">Don&#x2019;t Forget: Twestival Nashville Tonight</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/31/twestival-local-nashville-lets-get-quacky/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Twestival Local: Nashville, Let&#x2019;s Get Quacky\">Twestival Local: Nashville, Let&#x2019;s Get Quacky</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/03/this-weekend-the-most-unfortunately-named-urban-adventure-race-ever/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: The Most Unfortunately Named &#x201C;Urban Adventure&#x201D; Race Ever\">This Weekend: The Most Unfortunately Named &#x201C;Urban Adventure&#x201D; Race Ever</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/04/happy-hour-here-a-duck-there-a-duck/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Here A Duck, There A Duck\">Happy Hour: Here A Duck, There A Duck</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
