A few days ago, we made another big discovery: Tim has a <a href=\"http://timrosswsmv.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>. And on his blog, Tim writes poetry. So as you&#x2019;re just waking up and tuning into Tim&#x2019;s morning forecast over at <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com\" target=\"_blank\">WSMV</a>, we&#x2019;d also like to direct you to his <em>other</em> work:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://timrosswsmv.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/mr-snipper-zipper/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Mr. Snipper Zipper</strong></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I&#x2019;m afraid to wear my pants.<br>\nI&#x2019;m scared what&#x2019;s underneath.<br>\n&#x2018;Cause Mama says my zipper<br>\nHas tiny little teeth!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>* Based upon my very own childhood memories</em><br>\n<em></em><em>Original Poetry by Tim Ross / Copyright 2008  <a href=\"http://www.timross.com/\" target=\"_self\">www.timross.com</a></em></p>\n<p>Tim&#x2019;s pretty much a renaissance man: He authors kids&#x2019; books, paints pictures, fields a lot of redundant questions from kids about his job, and fills out weird internet surveys on his website. In other words, Tim is our hero.</p>"
