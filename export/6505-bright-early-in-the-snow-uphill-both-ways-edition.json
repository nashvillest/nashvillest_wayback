So how about that snow last night? And that commute? We don&#x2019;t even want to talk about that commute, really. <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=23902\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;wpln.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Though only about 1-3 inches of snow coated the city, the roads turned into a sheet of ice within minutes and reportedly left many folks sitting in rush hour traffic for 4-5 hours</a>. Cars were left abandoned on the side of the road (and in the middle of the road?), dozens of accidents were reported and <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/multiple-wrecks-force-police-focus-injury-accidents-only?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">police were forced to only respond to injury wrecks, of which there were plenty</a>. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/13999436/heavy-snow-causes-delays-for-thousands-of-drivers\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Because salt only melts snow down to about 26 degrees and it is 9 degrees as we write this, we don&#x2019;t expect to see things clear up much this morning and police are urging commuters to stay home</a>. Also, if you strike out to find the car you ditched yesterday and isn&#x2019;t where you left it, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=14004059&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">it&#x2019;s probably in Metro&#x2019;s impound lot</a>. Contact them at (615) 862-7800.
