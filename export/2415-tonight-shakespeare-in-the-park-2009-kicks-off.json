We love Shakespeare in the Park because it&#x2019;s a free and entertaining annual event that really brings the community together, and if you&#x2019;ve been reading Nashvillest for long, you know that we&#x2019;re (almost) always on board with that!</p>\n<p>This year, the Nashville Shakes will feature two performances &#x2013; <em>The Taming Of The Shrew</em>, today through August 23, and <em>The Complete Works Of William Shakespeare [Abridged]</em>, running August 27 through September 13. The free performances at the Centennial Park bandshell are Thursdays through Sundays within the specified dates, and the evening begins at 6:30pm with some pre-show entertainment.</p>\n<p>Of course, we have to remind you that donations are welcome (and maybe even encouraged). The Nashville Shakes go to great lengths every year to make Shakespeare In The Park such a great event for the Nashville community, so throw &#x2018;em a few bones to support their work.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/14/tonight-shakespeare-returns-to-centennial-park/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: Shakespeare Returns To Centennial Park\">Tonight: Shakespeare Returns To Centennial Park</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/28/get-your-dancing-shoes-ready-dancing-in-the-park-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Get Your Dancing Shoes Ready: Dancing In The Park 2009\">Get Your Dancing Shoes Ready: Dancing In The Park 2009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/21/movies-in-the-park-2010-kicks-off-june-2-with-where-the-wild-things-are/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;\">Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/20/summer-must-be-here-movies-in-the-park-are-back-for-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Summer Must Be Here: Movies In The Park Are Back For 2009\">Summer Must Be Here: Movies In The Park Are Back For 2009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/20/more-than-movies-in-the-park-this-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Than Movies In The Park This Year\">More Than Movies In The Park This Year</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
