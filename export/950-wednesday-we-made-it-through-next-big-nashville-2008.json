It&#x2019;s been rough on our day jobs, but we&#x2019;re willing to sacrifice sleep in the name of high-quality entertainment (and sneak a nap in on our lunch break).</p><p>The festival kicked off on Wednesday night with the first public screening of a locally made film,<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://makeoutwithviolence.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;makeoutwithviolence.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Make-Out With Violence</strong></em></a>. The Belcourt was packed for both screenings, and we heard that folks were turned away from both. Anticipation was high, and <em>Make-Out With Violence</em> did not disappoint, though it certainly had its confusing and startling moments. The film has been four years in the making, and in typical Nashville form, the soundtrack played a key role in guiding the audience through the (sometimes difficult to grasp) character development and plot. Check out the movie&#x2019;s website (linked above) for in-depth explanations and streams of the songs.</p><p>We ventured down to 12th &amp; Porter next to catch <strong><a href=\"http://ampersandep.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;ampersandep.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Webb &amp; Sandra McCracken</a></strong>. We just can&#x2019;t ever pass up an opportunity to see them. They played songs from their joint release,&#xA0;<em>Ampersand EP</em>, including their Bob Dylan cover of &#x201C;<em>If Not For You</em>.&#x201D; This is where we found out the best thing about Next Big Nashville. All of the shows run on time, and all of them are 30-45 minutes long. Yes, you heard us right &#x2013; <em>the shows run on time</em>. It&#x2019;s amazing.</p><p>After the extremely punctual Derek Webb/Sandra McCracken set, we had some time to kill before heading back to the Belcourt for <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thenoncommissionedofficers\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.myspace.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Noncommissioned Officers</strong></a>&#x2018; farewell performance. The group was formed for the sole purpose of creating and performing the <em>Make-Out With Violence</em> music, and they are now disbanding. Having just experienced the film several hours earlier, our expectations were higher than perhaps appropriate, but the experience was uniquely &#x201C;Nashville&#x201D; and just a tiny bit surreal.</p><p>Highlights from Thursday and our picks for the weekend coming soon.</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/03/free-music-nashvillians-have-the-right-idea/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Music: Nashvillians Have The Right Idea\">Free Music: Nashvillians Have The Right Idea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/19/tonight-the-nashville-9-concert-premiere/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: The Nashville 9 Concert &amp; Premiere\">Tonight: The Nashville 9 Concert &amp; Premiere</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/12/thursday-we-started-to-drag-next-big-nashville-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Thursday: We Started To Drag [Next Big Nashville 2008]\">Thursday: We Started To Drag [Next Big Nashville 2008]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/12/dear-nashvillest-what-shows-should-i-see-this-weekend-next-big-nashville-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Dear Nashvillest, What Shows Should I See This Weekend?
