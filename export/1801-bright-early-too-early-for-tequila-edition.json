We&#x2019;d like to take this opportunity to remind you that tonight is the night that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090415/COUNTY090101/90415024\" target=\"_blank\">Franklin will try to earn the prestigious title of Tequila Shot Capitol of the World by having around 1,300 people do tequila shots at the same time</a>, thus breaking the existing world record for simultaneous tequila shots. The City of Franklin is totally down with this as long as the organizers&#x2013;Sol Restaurant&#x2013;hire 8 off-duty police officers to hang out and keep folks safe, advertise a &#x201C;safe-ride&#x201D; program, and warn the neighbors with some flyers. So if you want to be a part of history, they&#x2019;ll be serving up the shots at 7:45pm and slamming them at 8 around Fourth Avenue and Main in downtown Franklin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be smart. </strong>Speaking of, Metro PD will be out in full force tonight to make sure no one is driving around drunk and putting us all in danger. They&#x2019;ll have about 30 extra officers out, 21 of which were funded by a &#x201C;special federal grant&#x201D; for stuff like this.
