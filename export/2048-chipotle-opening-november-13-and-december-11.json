That&#x2019;s right, Nashville is going to have two Chipotles by the end of the year, and Green Hills is going to have just a little more traffic than usual.

This is Chipotle Chief Officer of the Bring Chipotle to Nashville group (kindly designated so by Mr. Kyle Chowning!)</p><p>I am pleased to let all of you know that we are indeed opening our first Chipotle restaurant at 2825 West End Avenue, which I think most of you have already figured out. We are looking to open on Friday, November 13th.</p><p>What you all probably don&#x2019;t know is that I&#x2019;m prepared to announce a second site, opening about a month later. The location is in Green Hills and we&#x2019;re opening on December 11th. I&#x2019;ll let you know the location as soon as I can let that cat out of the bag, which will be very, very soon.</p><p>Thank you all for your support and I look forward to meeting a bunch of Chipotle fans at our grand openings!</p><p>Bobby Shaw</p></blockquote><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/10/nashvilles-first-chipotle-opens-friday-free-burritos-tomorrow-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville&#x2019;s First Chipotle Opens Friday; Free Burritos Tomorrow [Freebies]\">Nashville&#x2019;s First Chipotle Opens Friday; Free Burritos Tomorrow [Freebies]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/26/chipotle-to-enter-nashville-market-soon-we-hope/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Chipotle To Enter Nashville Market Soon (We Hope)\">Chipotle To Enter Nashville Market Soon (We Hope)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/19/because-we-really-really-need-more-burritos-chipotle-chuys-updates/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Because We Really, Really Need More Burritos: Chipotle &amp; Chuy&#x2019;s Updates\">Because We Really, Really Need More Burritos: Chipotle &amp; Chuy&#x2019;s Updates</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/28/tonight-graces-plaza-wine-spirits-grand-opening/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: Grace&#x2019;s Plaza Wine &amp; Spirits Grand Opening\">Tonight: Grace&#x2019;s Plaza Wine &amp; Spirits Grand Opening</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/09/grand-openings-galore-the-wild-cow-taco-mamacita-more/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Grand Openings Galore: The Wild Cow, Taco Mamacita &amp; More\">Grand Openings Galore: The Wild Cow, Taco Mamacita &amp; More</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
