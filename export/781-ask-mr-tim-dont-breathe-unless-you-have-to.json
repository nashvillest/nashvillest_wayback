When we realized we had no idea what that meant, we decided to ask the expert&#x2013;<a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com\" target=\"_blank\">Channel 4</a> meteorologist <a href=\"http://www.timross.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Ross</a>. It&#x2019;s no secret that <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/06/bright-early-we-love-our-weatherman-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashvillest loves Mr. Tim</a> for his crazy forecasts, amazing tie collection and <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/17/tall-tales-tim-ross-and-the-toothed-zipper/\" target=\"_blank\">silly poetry</a>. In light of <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/weather/17097693/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news#-\" target=\"_blank\">today&#x2019;s Orange Alert</a>, he&#x2019;s been kind enough to break it down a bit and give us some valuable advice: Don&#x2019;t breathe unless you have to. Mr. Tim&#x2019;s take, after the jump:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-781\"></span></p>\n<p><em>The Air Quality Index is a standard based upon guidelines established by the Environmental Protection Agency.   Somehow you just knew the government had to be involved in this, didn&#x2019;t you?  And isn&#x2019;t it great to see your tax dollars so hard at work!!! Don&#x2019;t get me started!!!</em></p>\n<p><em>Though the EPA has developed a phone book sized guide to understanding the AQI,  let me try simplify this thing.   Bottom line&#x2026;the AQI tells you whether the air you&#x2019;re breathing is clean or dirty&#x2026; simple as that!  The daily AQI is particularly concerned with the health effects you&#x2019;ll suffer in the short term&#x2026; the next day or so. The AQI considers five major air pollutants; ground-level ozone, airborne particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.  Ground-level ozone and particulates are the two pollutants that pose the greatest health threats. Don&#x2019;t breathe unless you have to! :)</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-782\" title=\"picture-5\" src=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/picture-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"410\" height=\"226\"></a></em></p>\n<p><em>You can forget all of the hoo-hah associated with the AQI&#x2026; just concentrate on a single number.  Generally speaking, an AQI lower than 100 represents a healthy situation.  Anything over 100 is cause for concern, especially for those people with related health issues, ie: heart or respiratory ailments and/or advanced age.  The higher the number the greater the health risk for everyone.</em></p>\n<p><em>One last thing, and this is just my personal observation over time&#x2014;Please know that 42.7% of all statistics are made up on the spot.  Or was that 43.5%?</em></p>\n<p><em>Chart courtesy of the EPA.</em></p>\n<p>Thanks for clearing that up, Mr. Tim!</p>"
