These discount gift certificate sales are celebrated occasions in the Nashvillest HQ, and we were all the more excited to see that a few Franklin favorites have been added to the lineup. Red Pony, SOL and 55 South in Franklin have joined forces with our esteemed Originals, and DrinkHaus in Germantown is also joining the party. We just can&#x2019;t decide if this means there will be more discount gift certificates to go around, or just more frantic fans vying for them.</p><p>Get your discount gift certificates (30-40% off face value) <a href=\"http://www.instagift.com/nashvilleoriginals\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a> beginning early tomorrow morning, June 16.
