And tomorrow night, you&#x2019;ve got the chance to <a href=\"http://sitemason.vanderbilt.edu/myvu/news/2009/03/26/brooks-fund-welcomes-new-york-times-bestselling-author-augusten-burroughs-to-nashville.76243\" target=\"_blank\">catch him in person at Vandy&#x2019;s Ingram Hall for a free reading, discussion, and book signing</a>.</p>\n<p>For a fourth-grade dropout, former foster kid, sexual abuse survivor, and recovering alcoholic, Burroughs has done alright for himself. Aside from <em>Running With Scissors</em>, he&#x2019;s published four other memoirs <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/augusten-burroughs-writing-saved-my-sanity-434920.html\" target=\"_blank\">chronicling his outrageously dysfunctional childhood and his journey in and out of alcoholism</a> in a way that landed him a spot on Entertainment Weekly&#x2019;s list of the 25 funniest people in America, twice. His first book, <em>Sellevision</em>, is also being adapted into a feature film (and we can only hope and pray they do a better job than they did with <em>Running With Scissors</em>.)</p>\n<p>We won&#x2019;t lie&#x2013;we&#x2019;ve been pretty partial to Burroughs for a few years now for the hope and hilarity he brings to the table with his memoirs. We&#x2019;re also partial to the folks at the <a href=\"http://www.thebrooksfund.org/\">Brooks Fund</a>, who will receive a portion of the book sale proceeds from the evening. A very special thanks to Lightning 100, the Nashville Scene, Davis-Kidd, NowPlayingNashville, and Vandy for making it happen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Augusten Burroughs</strong><br>\nIngram Hall<br>\nVanderbilt University<br>\nWednesday, April 8th 2009, 7pm<br>\nFREE</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/illustratorian/302223820/\" target=\"_blank\">illustrator ian</a>. </em></p>"
