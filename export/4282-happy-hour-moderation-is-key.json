Predictably, the state immediately terminated his contract and he&#x2019;s on 90-day suspension as Chief Medical Examiner for the city of Nashville.

No, this does not mean that you should avoid the checkpoints. Yes, this does mean that you should not drive drunk. If you find yourself in a pinch, the Davidson County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office is offering sober rides until 2am if you call 862-RIDE.

Unfortunately, some federally endangered crayfish were also found dead and the pollution comes from airplane de-icing.
