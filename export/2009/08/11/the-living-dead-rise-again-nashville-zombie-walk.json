The semi-annual event is one of our favorite <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=nashville+zombie+walk\" target=\"_blank\">picture-taking opportunities</a>, and we&#x2019;re happy to hear that they&#x2019;ve set another date. On September 19 at 4pm, Riverfront Park will be filled with the undead &#x2013; Zombie children, zombie dogs, zombie ballerinas and probably some zombie protesters thrown in for good measure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There also appears to be a special zombie event later that evening in order to get some mileage out of those fake wounds and theatrical makeup.
