Like <a href=\"http://www.redbullflugtagusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">homemade flying contraptions</a> flopping to their watery graves, thousands of <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/23/this-weekend-great-nashville-duck-race/\" target=\"_blank\">rubber duckies racing</a> downstream, and the annual <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/20/this-weekend-dragon-boat-river-festival/\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Boat races</a>, where teams of 20 race each other in the ornate (and sort of awkward looking) boats, complete with viking caps and pirate garb.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The 2009 <a href=\"http://www.nashvilledragonboat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Boat &amp; River Festival</a> kicks off this Saturday at the downtown riverfront, and it&#x2019;s an entertaining (and free) way to spend the day, even if you&#x2019;re not hitting the paddles (<em>especially</em> if you&#x2019;re not hitting the paddles &#x2013; at least, if you&#x2019;re lazy like us). The races begin bright and sort-of-early at 9am, and continue well into the afternoon. Fun for families with kids, as well as the lurking blogger or two, the Dragon Boat &amp; River Festival has scored itself a permanent space on our calendar every year.
