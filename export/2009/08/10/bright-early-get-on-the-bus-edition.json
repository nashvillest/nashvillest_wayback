This weekend was a good one for the Titans, who <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10874820\" target=\"_blank\">took down the Buffalo Bills 21-18 in their first preseason game of 2009</a>. We hear Kerry Collins put on quite a show until Vince Young took over in the second quarter. The opening game was not without incident, however, as runningbacks Chris Johnson and LenDale White missed the bus to Fawcett Stadium in Ohio because <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/johnson-goes-back-gold-teeth-misses-bus-stadium\" target=\"_blank\">Johnson was too busy tending to his gold teeth and twittering about it</a>. This is why we love you, CJ.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>School&#x2019;s in.</strong> Most of the kiddos head back to school today and Middle Tennessee schools are <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090809/NEWS01/90809006/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">already laying down the law about handling swine flu outbreaks</a>. Last school year ended with several school systems shutting down during final exams at the recommendation of the CDC.</li>\n<li><strong>More council controversy. </strong>Metro councilman Mike Craddock is in some hot water with his constituents after <a href=\"http://www.outandaboutnewspaper.com/article/3618\" target=\"_blank\">making a statement about Nashville&#x2019;s new male strip club many folks perceive as sexist</a>: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sick to my stomach &#x2013; I&#x2019;m just absolutely sick. It&#x2019;s different for a man to show himself than a woman. It&#x2019;s another step in the wrong direction.&#x201D;</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>. Nashville malls were <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090810/NEWS01/908100340/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">likened to mosh pits</a> during the tax-free sales this weekend &#x2026; Everyone&#x2019;s favorite blogging rep, Stacey Campfield, will be <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/28beab24-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">taking a stab at a senate seat</a> &#x2026; A quick <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10871961\" target=\"_blank\">recap of the Tomato Art Fest</a> for those who didn&#x2019;t make it &#x2026; Montgomery County might be the next in line to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10875573\" target=\"_blank\">opt out of the new guns in parks law</a> &#x2026; Tonight&#x2019;s Def Leppard show at the Sommet Center <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090810/COLUMNIST0501/908100333\" target=\"_blank\">has been postponed</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
