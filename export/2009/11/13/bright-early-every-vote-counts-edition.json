The District 5 recall election between Metro Councilwoman Pam Murray and rabble-rousing challenger Jamie Hollins <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11496863\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">was a little too close for comfort last night with the current tally at 541-538 in favor of Hollins</a>. At least three provisional ballots still haven&#x2019;t been counted, which means the race could tip in either direction.
