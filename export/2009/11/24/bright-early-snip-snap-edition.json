Each year, 23 neighborhood health clinics around the state provide health care for uninsured Tennesseans&#x2013;a number that&#x2019;s growing by the day thanks to our 10.5% unemployment rate. Like every other department in the State of Tennessee, the Department of Health is looking at a 9% overall cut. With the loss of state funding, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11561416\" target=\"_blank\">many of the clinics could be forced to close down or at least limit their services</a>.
