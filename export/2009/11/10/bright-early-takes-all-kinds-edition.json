If you&#x2019;ve been in this town for a few years, you may remember the feuding between Metro and the Nashville Sounds about a new stadium by the riverfront that never ended up happening. To say that things got tense would be an understatement, as Metro decided show us all how they <em>really </em>felt by bulldozing a chunk of the Sounds&#x2019; parking lot on opening day. <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/sounds-may-find-new-home-riverfront-after-all\" target=\"_blank\">The team has since changed ownership and the city has changed mayors, so the possibility of a new stadium may be back on the table</a>. Metro officials and the Sounds owners met a few weeks ago to discuss three potential locations for the project and although nothing is definite, we expect to be hearing more in the coming months.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Suspicious package downtown.</strong> Broadway was shut down for a couple of hours this morning when police discovered <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/21570128/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">a suspicious package downtown which turned out to be a cooler that belonged to a homeless man</a>.
