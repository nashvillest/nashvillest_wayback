Looks like we&#x2019;re in for six more weeks of winter (though you wouldn&#x2019;t know it if you went outside yesterday) <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090202/NEWS08/90202008/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">according to Punxsutawney Phil who saw his shadow this morning</a>. We&#x2019;d like to take a moment to pause and observe the above photograph of poor Punxsutawney Phil that accompanied the <em>Tennessean&#x2019;s </em>Ground Hog Day article this morning. We came dangerously close to having a case of the Mondays until we realized that no matter how much we hate today, Punxsutawney Phil is probably up in Pennsylvania hating it more.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It just gets better and better.</strong> Nothing seems to be going right for Metro Schools these days. This time around, they&#x2019;ve discovered that someone botched the school calendar and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090201/NEWS04/902010394/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">accidentally didn&#x2019;t schedule enough days in the school year</a> to comply with federal regulations. No more snow days for you, kids!
