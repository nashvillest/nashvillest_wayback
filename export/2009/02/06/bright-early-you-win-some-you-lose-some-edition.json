We have to admint we&#x2019;re not real surprised to hear the news this morning that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090205/BUSINESS01/90205071/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">those super-ugly condos on the corner of 5th and Main in East Nashville aren&#x2019;t actually selling</a> like they were supposed to. The sorry state of the economy and housing market and probably the fact that they&#x2019;re kind of atrocious-looking may have something to do with only seven or eight of the 130 units selling. Consequently, Wachovia has stepped in and taken control because the owners are, oh, about $29 million in the hole.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>School daze.</strong> Metro Police arrested 12 Hunters Lane High School students yesterday and charged two with <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9798504\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">assaulting an assistant principal and campus supervisor</a>. As Channel 5 astutely observes, &#x201C;<span>[n]o parent wants to see teens hauled out of their child&#x2019;s school in handcuffs.&#x201D; Uh, yeah.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Sob stories. </strong>Because it&#x2019;s apparently illegal to let your car heat up in the morning without you in it, Metro Police have been taking advantage of the cold snap to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9798963\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">dole out some extra tickets</a>. So if your 6-month old kid has a fever and it&#x2019;s 17 degrees outside, don&#x2019;t go heat up your car before you take them to the hospital.
