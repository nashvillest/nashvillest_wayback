Raffle prizes will be given throughout the night from a bunch of great local businesses, and several event sponsors will be giving out free swag at the event all night. Please note that the Big Bang is 21+. We&#x2019;re so sorry to disappoint our underage readers, and promise we didn&#x2019;t forget about you in planning this.</p>\n<p>Though we&#x2019;re calling it a Tweet-up, every single one of you are invited! We&#x2019;re one of over 175 cities hosting a Twestival that night and we&#x2019;ll be livestreaming the event in partnership with LiveEarth. We&#x2019;d love to pack the place out and show them exactly what kind of a city we are. So come on out, mix and mingle with Nashville&#x2019;s Twitter and blogging community, and let&#x2019;s meet our goal of raising $4,000 for Charity:Water!</p>\n<p><strong>Please buy your tickets in advance so we know how many people to expect.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.amiando.com/twestivalnashville.html\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to purchase tickets</a>. Remember, this may seem like a steep cover charge, but it&#x2019;s a direct donation to <a href=\"http://www.charitywater.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Charity:Water</a>. Your $10 donation provides one person with clean water for TEN YEARS. If you wish to make additional donations, you can go to <a href=\"http://www.charitywater.org/twestival\" target=\"_blank\">charitywater.org/twestival</a> and select &#x201C;Nashville&#x201D; from the drop-down menu.</p>\n<p>Invite your friends &#x2013; We need word to spread far and beyond what we can do ourselves. Blog about it, tweet about it, Facebook about it&#x2026;</p>\n<p>We can&#x2019;t wait to see you there!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/02/12/its-party-time-come-to-twestival-nashville-tonight/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: It&#x2019;s Party Time: Come To Twestival Nashville Tonight!\">It&#x2019;s Party Time: Come To Twestival Nashville Tonight!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/22/twestival-global-returns-to-nashville-this-thursday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Twestival Global Returns To Nashville This Thursday\">Twestival Global Returns To Nashville This Thursday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/31/twestival-local-nashville-lets-get-quacky/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Twestival Local: Nashville, Let&#x2019;s Get Quacky\">Twestival Local: Nashville, Let&#x2019;s Get Quacky</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/10/dont-forget-twestival-nashville-tonight/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Forget: Twestival Nashville Tonight\">Don&#x2019;t Forget: Twestival Nashville Tonight</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/30/twestival-nashville-save-the-date-no-were-not-getting-married/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Twestival Nashville: Save The Date (No, We&#x2019;re Not Getting Married)\">Twestival Nashville: Save The Date (No, We&#x2019;re Not Getting Married)</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
