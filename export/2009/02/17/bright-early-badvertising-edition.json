As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures. With Metro schools now looking at being about $16 million in the hole, they&#x2019;re taking a look at some creative ways to bring in the dough&#x2013;the latest of which is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9854079\" target=\"_blank\">selling advertising space on Metro school buses</a>. It&#x2019;s already legal to sell black and white bus ads in Tennessee, but they think colored ads would entice more businesses to actually buy them. A lot of folks seem to support at least looking into it, but some parents feel like it would be tacky&#x2026; though not as tacky, we think, as a $16 million deficit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ah-CHOO! </strong>Are you one of the lucky folks who <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9851804\" target=\"_blank\">haven&#x2019;t gotten the flu yet</a>? Watch out, because Tennessee&#x2019;s state health experts say you could be in for a real doozy.</li>\n<li><strong>Bad education.</strong> Layoffs are in store for the Community Education program which includes adult literacy, activities for senior citizens, and English as a Second Language. Apparently the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=66143\" target=\"_blank\">program has been running on a $1,300-per-day deficit</a>, but community leaders fear that downsizing this kind of program would have a pretty negative impact on the city as a whole.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Tonight is the night that the Metro Council will talk about <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9855979\" target=\"_blank\">raising our water bills</a> &#x2026; We feel like we should acknowledge (but not congratulate) Lipscomb for <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=66144\" target=\"_blank\">winning four games in a row</a> including <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290430288\" target=\"_blank\">the one against our alma mater</a> last Thursday &#x2026; Rough night for cops patrolling the highway last night, after one guy <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9855069\" target=\"_blank\">took a few shots a police officer</a> on I-440 near Hillsboro and another guy was picked up for <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9856807\" target=\"_blank\">driving the wrong way on I-40</a> in Bellevue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/peepthisbradley/3270042309/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">B.
