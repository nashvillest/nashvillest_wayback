We feel like it&#x2019;s safe to say that we left our mark on the Grammy&#x2019;s last night. Sure, Miley and Taylor were no Stevie Wonder and the Jonas Brothers, but <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090208/TUNEIN/90208027/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Plant and Alison Krauss walked home with five Grammy&#x2019;s</a> including Best Album and Best Record. Carrie Underwood, Kenny Chesney, Sugarland, and Keith &amp; Nicole all made appearances, and even Kid Rock showed up and managed not to embarrass us too much. All in all, it was a pretty decent night for the folks who call Music City home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free at last.</strong> Teenage hooligans all around Metro are rejoicing with the latest budget cut which <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18659863/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">removes electronic ankle monitors from the juvenile justice system</a> completely. Guess they&#x2019;ll just have to stick with the good old-fashioned ball &#x2018;n&#x2019; chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Sinking ship.</strong> The feds are now freezing $5M in grants to Metro Nashville Public Schools because someone found out that they used their last grant for $1.6M illegally. Par for the course.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Metro Action Commission is <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9805593\" target=\"_blank\">running out of money</a> to bail us all out of our sky-high electric bills &#x2026; This is what happens when you go to a BBQ joint to interview people about <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9808240\" target=\"_blank\">pork barrel spending</a> &#x2026; The TVA may be <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9809979\" target=\"_blank\">lowering rates</a> soon &#x2026; Gov.
