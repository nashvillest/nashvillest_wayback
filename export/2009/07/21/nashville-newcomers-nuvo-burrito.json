Enter <a href=\"http://www.nuvoburrito.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuvo Burrito</a>, tucked into the old Z&#x2019;s Deli space in East Nashville&#x2019;s Five Points, and now soft-opened to the public.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We dropped in last night to see if Nuvo is the answer to East Nashville&#x2019;s burrito needs. When we marched in 20 minutes before they were set to close for the evening, we were astonished at the amount of people inside. At least a dozen customers were ordering or seated, which gave us plenty of time to take in the overwhelming menus displayed on two large flatscreen TVs. Burritos range in price from $6.99 &#x2013; $8.99, chips &amp; salsa will ding you $2.50, and there&#x2019;s no queso to be found on the menu, much to our chagrin. Nuvo Burrito also offers an impressive selection of quesadillas on the menu, though you wouldn&#x2019;t guess it by their name. Both burritos and quesadillas are filled with unique, fresh ingredients &#x2013; We&#x2019;re talking spinach, artichoke, hearty brown grains, black beans, cilantro pesto, sweet potatoes, cajun shrimp, bacon bits, caramelized onions and more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite costing over $10 for a meal (with chips and drinks), our burritos were worth the cost. Our vegetarian burrito was served in a bright green spinach tortilla and loaded to the brim with fillings, and our &#x201C;Gulf Coaster&#x201D; was equally as satisfying. Many of Nuvo&#x2019;s burrito concepts stray so far from the traditional burrito that at times, it may be best to consider it a giant, warm gourmet wrap. Not that we&#x2019;re complaining about that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We&#x2019;d petition for a salsa bar, queso dip and some fresh, warm chips if we were going to complain about something. Other than that, Nuvo Burrito has entered the East Nashville market with a bang, with neighborhood residents already pouring through their doors every day. The four owners are so excited about making creative burritos that it&#x2019;s hard to imagine their concept doing poorly. We were excitedly told about plans to offer a &#x201C;Guest Burrito Of The Day,&#x201D; some special tomato-y offerings for their grand opening at the Tomato Art Fest, and plans for additional chain locations. Nuvo Burrito is (for now) open 11am-8pm every day, so show &#x2018;em some love. Welcome to town, Nuvo!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">UPDATE: Nuvo Burrito has launched their website, which includes a pdf of their menu for the curious. <a href=\"http://www.nuvoburrito.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to visit NuvoBurrito.com</a>!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Photo by Nashvillest. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nashvillest/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for more photos of Nuvo Burrito!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/09/9909-is-a-magical-baja-burrito-birthday-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: 9/9/09 Is A Magical Baja Burrito Birthday [Freebies]\">9/9/09 Is A Magical Baja Burrito Birthday [Freebies]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/30/nashville-newcomers-fresh-blends-juice-smoothie-bar/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar\">Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/24/duck-duck-who-the-silly-goose-entering-eastland-nashville-newcomers/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Duck, Duck, Who?
