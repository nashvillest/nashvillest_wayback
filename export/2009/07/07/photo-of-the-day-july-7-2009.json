 "excerpt": "In the age of Photoshop filters, it’s always refreshing to see some for-real, honest-to-goodness lomography. Flickr user sjcapps experimented with a few different subjects around Nashville using a four-lense SuperSampler and this junkyard shot was one of our favorites. Photo Of The Day will be a recurring feature for Nashvillest as long you keep giving us stuff to post. Don’t worry–we’ll give you props. Just add them to the pool or tag them with “Nashvillest” if you’re feeling lazy.",
