Well, nothing has really changed, but we&#x2019;re here to make hauling the family out of town just a little bit easier. With steep discounts, freebies and even free transportation, taking the kids to ride some rollercoasters can be mostly fun and only a <em>little</em> frazzle.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sixflags.com/kentuckyKingdom/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">SIX FLAGS</a></strong></p>\n<p>Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom is just a few hours&#x2019; drive, and if you <a href=\"http://www.sixflags.com/kentuckykingdom/tickets/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">purchase tickets online</a> (or at Arby&#x2019;s), everyone pays the kids&#x2019; price of $24.99! Or make a weekend of it and buy the Big Six Pass, which includes six visits for just $29.99 through November. Head down on a Starburst Summer Concert day and get even more bang for your buck &#x2013; concert tickets are included in the price of admission.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://holidayworld.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HOLIDAY WORLD</a></strong></p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ll just go ahead and admit it &#x2013; We&#x2019;re REALLY excited about Holiday World. We can&#x2019;t wait to make the trek to Santa Claus, Indiana to visit wonderful Thanksgivingland and 4th of Julyland and see a play about good ol&#x2019; Honest Abe. <a href=\"http://www.ticketsnashville.com/WebSales/Pages/CatalogProductInfo.aspx?catinfo=516~39762106-c043-4b3b-b1b7-95303044beb9&amp;epguid=e6679d67-10aa-424a-82f0-bf9acc57df3f&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">And for just $34</a>, the Holiday World Express &#x201C;luxurious motorcoach&#x201D; will pick you up from one of its stops in Murfreesboro, Cool Springs, Donelson or Rivergate, and take you straight to Holiday World. Admission included in the $34! Holiday World also boasts free unlimited soft drinks and sunblock. Regular admission price is $39.95 and does NOT include a luxurious motorcoach ride from Nashville to Santa Claus. Can&#x2019;t beat that!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvilleshores.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NASHVILLE SHORES</a></strong></p>\n<p>Nashville Shores is still hanging on in town, and <a href=\"http://halfoffdepot.com/nashville/nashville-shores.html\" target=\"_blank\">half price tickets</a>&#xA0;to a waterpark are sounding really good right now. Grab two regular admission tickets for $25, half the usual price.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>HOMETOWN TOURISM</strong></p>\n<p>Theme parks a little wild for the whole family? The Nashville Visitor&#x2019;s Bureau is offering some great deals this summer on local attractions. Stop by the Visitor Center in the Sommet Center to <a href=\"http://www.visitmusiccity.com/summerfun/\" target=\"_blank\">grab a book of 2-for-1 coupons</a> to the Adventure Science Center, Nashville Zoo, Cheekwood, Delta Riverboats at Opryland, Frist Center, The Hermitage, Music City Duck Tours and even Nashville Shores.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Or grab a <a href=\"http://www.visitmusiccity.com/visitors/TotalAccess\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Total Access Pass</a> for $45, and get admission to four participating attractions of your choice, plus bonus admission to the Parthenon. If you stack the attractions with the hefty admission prices, you&#x2019;re bound to come out ahead. Choose Nashville Shores ($25), Music City Duck Tours ($20), General Jackson Showboat cruise ($20) and the Nashville Zoo ($14), and you&#x2019;re saving at least $34 (the perfect amount to tuck away for that trip to Holiday World).</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/photoflounder/3573374065/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>photoFlounder</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/01/beyond-elmington-park-the-tennessee-renaissance-festival/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Beyond Elmington Park: The Tennessee Renaissance Festival\">Beyond Elmington Park: The Tennessee Renaissance Festival</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/20/summer-must-be-here-movies-in-the-park-are-back-for-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Summer Must Be Here: Movies In The Park Are Back For 2009\">Summer Must Be Here: Movies In The Park Are Back For 2009</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
