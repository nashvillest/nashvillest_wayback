Life at the Spring Hill GM plant has been a rollercoaster over the past few months with the announcement that production would halt indefinitely after November and the subsequent loss of the bid for GM&#x2019;s new smaller car. The latest talk involves <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090707/BUSINESS01/907070346/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">several new manufacturing possibilities that could keep the plant open</a>.

Many folks wonder if the tax dollars saved by the contracts are worth keeping the jobs overseas.</li>\n<li><strong>More questions.</strong> In another bizarre twist in the McNair case, police have discovered that some guy may have <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10652774\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">updated his Myspace status two days before the murder to read, &#x201C;Who is McNair in 09?
