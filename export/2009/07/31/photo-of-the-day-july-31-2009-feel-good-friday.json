She does have some problems just  like an older person, like arthritis. That slows her down a little bit, but  we&#x2019;re really glad she&#x2019;s able to move pretty well,&#x201D; said zoo employee Emily  Johnson. Muffy celebrated her birthday with a treat of ice filled with fruit, cheerios  and raisins.
