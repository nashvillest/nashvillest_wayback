Remember back in August of last year (yes, almost a full 12 months ago) when we <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/01/cold-treats-tasti-d-lite-comes-to-town/\" target=\"_blank\">excitedly announced that New York-based frozen yogurt chain Tasti D-Lite was coming to town</a>? Yeah, well, we weren&#x2019;t lying! They came to town and they put up some eye-catching signs&#x2026; And then we sat here and waited&#x2026; and waited&#x2026; and waited. But we will wait no more!</p>\n<p>Tennessee&#x2019;s first <a href=\"http://www.tastidlite.com/index.php/component/option,com_location/location,88\" target=\"_blank\">Tasti D-Lite</a> will open its doors tomorrow at 2418 West End Avenue, at the intersection of Elliston and West End. Last August, when Tasti D-Lite first announced their expansion, our options for frozen yogurt in Nashville were painfully limited. The fro-yo scene has changed since then, with <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/22/krave-frozen-yogurt-were-getting-closer-to-pinkberry-every-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Krave</a>, <a href=\"http://sweetceces.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweet CeCe&#x2019;s</a> and Provence&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.YummiYo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yummi Yo!</a> springing up to join <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/12/reviews-yogurt-oasis-been-there-done-that/\" target=\"_blank\">Yogurt Oasis</a> as the city&#x2019;s yogurt providers. Sounds like it&#x2019;s time for a Yogurt Showdown in town&#x2026;</p>\n<p><em>Photo from </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/TastiNash\" target=\"_blank\"><em>@TastiNash</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/01/cold-treats-tasti-d-lite-comes-to-town/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Cold Treats: Tasti D-Lite Comes To Town\">Cold Treats: Tasti D-Lite Comes To Town</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/12/reviews-yogurt-oasis-been-there-done-that/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Reviews: Yogurt Oasis [Been There, Done That]\">Reviews: Yogurt Oasis [Been There, Done That]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/12/for-real-this-time-pinkberry-coming-to-nashville-and-cool-springs/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: For Real, This Time: Pinkberry Coming To Nashville, Cool Springs\">For Real, This Time: Pinkberry Coming To Nashville, Cool Springs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/10/nashvilles-first-chipotle-opens-friday-free-burritos-tomorrow-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville&#x2019;s First Chipotle Opens Friday; Free Burritos Tomorrow [Freebies]\">Nashville&#x2019;s First Chipotle Opens Friday; Free Burritos Tomorrow [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/22/krave-frozen-yogurt-were-getting-closer-to-pinkberry-every-day/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Krave Frozen Yogurt: We&#x2019;re Getting Closer To Pinkberry Every Day\">Krave Frozen Yogurt: We&#x2019;re Getting Closer To Pinkberry Every Day</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
