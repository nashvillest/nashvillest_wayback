The Metro Council sponsor for the controversial May Town Center proposal seems to have given up for the time being, announcing yesterday that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090701/NEWS01/907010400/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">he&#x2019;s going to defer it indefinitely at the next council meeting</a>. The Metro Planning Commission determined that it was a bad idea last week and it probably would&#x2019;ve failed in the council anyway, so this development shouldn&#x2019;t be too shocking. However, we don&#x2019;t expect we&#x2019;ve heard that last of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On the mend.</strong> Sgt. Mark Chesnut, the officer injured in last week&#x2019;s I-40 shooting, is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10604864\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">doing a little better and his condition has been upgraded from critical to critical but stable</a>. And as for the suspects, they&#x2019;re appearing in court today and the <em>Tennessean </em>will be posting some video shortly.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspicious what? </strong>And for your morning dose of Creepy, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10621351\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">some cadaver dogs in training came across a &#x201C;suspicious mound&#x201D; out by the airport</a>.
