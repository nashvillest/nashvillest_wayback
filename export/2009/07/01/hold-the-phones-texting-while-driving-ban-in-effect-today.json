Today is the day that the texting while driving ban officially hits the books, much to the chagrin of chronic crackberry-ers and speedy T9-ers alike. You all voiced some <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/15/texting-what-do-you-think-nashvillest-polls/\" target=\"_blank\">strong opinions about the ban</a> a couple months ago, and the day of judgement has arrived.</p>\n<p>Now that texting while driving is illegal, will you be putting down the phone while driving, or will you be taking your chances?</p>\n<p>Some other things you can&#x2019;t do starting today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visit the Main Branch of the library on a Monday.</strong> Our city is broke, the newer slimmer budget goes into effect today, and Mondays at the Main Branch were one of the things that had to go. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Bordeaux, Edmondson, Green Hills, Hermitage, and Madison will all be opening at 10am instead of 9:30am on Mondays, too</span>. All other branches are unchanged. <strong>CORRECTION:</strong> Bordeaux, Edmondson Pike, Green Hills, Hermitage, Madison, AND Southeast branches of the library will open at 10 am every day not just Mondays. And the Main library closes at 6 instead of 8 on Tuesday-Thursday.
