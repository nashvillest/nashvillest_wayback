In case you missed it yesterday, police are on the lookout for a 5&#x2032;6&#x2033;, 140 lb. Hispanic man <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10776440\" target=\"_blank\">who&#x2019;s been grabbing women&#x2019;s butts as they jog along Belmont Boulevard</a>. Based on the reports received so far, it seems to be happening between 5am and 6:30am, and the man lurks in his white four-door car with tinted windows before popping out and grabbing. If you&#x2019;ve seen anything suspicious or even been a victim yourself, please report it to Metro so they can catch this creep. In the meantime, ladies, be careful!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leave the guns at home.</strong> Metro&#x2019;s law director has now said that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090723/NEWS0202/907230356/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville has an existing ordinance banning guns from parks which is not overridden by the new state law</a>. Because the law was passed before 1986, there&#x2019;s some legal mumbo jumbo that says it gets to stay in place regardless of what state law says. If that turns out to be the case, then we shouldn&#x2019;t need to opt out.</li>\n<li><strong>We &lt;3 Jet Noise. </strong>Airport officials are warning the folks who live nearby that they may be hearing more noise over the next few months. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090723/NEWS01/907230350/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">BNA is shutting down one of their four runways for construction</a> meaning that all flights will be squeezed into the three remaining runways so those flight paths will be used with more frequency.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The Tennessean <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090723/FEATURES01/907230319/-1/RSS05\">helps us understand the utilikilt phenomenon</a>, and if there were ever a time to scroll down and read the comments, it would be now &#x2026; A convenience store clerk who was shot back in 2000 died from his injuries this week, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/20148170/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">making the incident a homicide 9 years later</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/politics/20143926/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Former President Bill Clinton is speaking in Nashville</a> at a Democratic fundraising dinner next month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A year ago on Nashvillest:</strong> We were <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/23/happy-hour-when-cute-becomes-creepy/\" target=\"_blank\">a little creeped out by the guy who wrote a weird song </a>about Keith and Nicole&#x2019;s new baby, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/23/tonight-backyard-at-the-belcourt/\" target=\"_blank\">caught Will Hoge</a> in the Belcourt&#x2019;s backyard, wondered which locals <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/23/our-citys-best-as-told-by-aol/\" target=\"_blank\">refer to Pancake Pantry as PanPan</a>, and got an update on <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/23/bright-early-pauly-bear-and-snoogums-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the most epic newspaper ad breakups of all time</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulnich/3747032607/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Nicholson</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
