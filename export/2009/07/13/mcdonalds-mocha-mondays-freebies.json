We&#x2019;re fairly unimpressed with McDonald&#x2019;s coffee, since it&#x2019;s not really that much cheaper and certainly not better than visiting one of the 6,928 independently-owned coffee shops for our morning pick-me-up. But for the low cost of free, we might be persuaded to try out McDonald&#x2019;s new espresso drinks &#x2013; Exactly what they&#x2019;re hoping to accomplish with new McDonald&#x2019;s Mocha Mondays.</p>\n<p>Every Monday, beginning today and running through August 3,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www2.mcdonalds.com/mccafe/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www2.mcdonalds.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">McDonald&#x2019;s will give out free sample size (8oz) iced or hot mochas</a> in hopes that we&#x2019;ll all build up Pavlovian responses and flock to McDonald&#x2019;s every Monday morning for the rest of our lives. The offer is valid from 7am-7pm at participating McDonald&#x2019;s.</p>\n<p>Call your McDonald&#x2019;s of choice before visiting to ensure that they are participating. We love our readers, but not enough to call every Mickey D&#x2019;s in town.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/21/more-sweet-treats-dunkin-donuts-iced-coffee-day-almost-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Sweet Treats: Dunkin Donuts&#x2019; Iced Coffee Day [Almost Freebies]\">More Sweet Treats: Dunkin Donuts&#x2019; Iced Coffee Day [Almost Freebies]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/28/free-coffee-snacks-at-panera-today-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Coffee &amp; Snacks At Panera Today [Freebies]\">Free Coffee &amp; Snacks At Panera Today [Freebies]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/14/no-need-to-pack-a-lunch-tomorrow/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: No Need To Pack A Lunch Tomorrow\">No Need To Pack A Lunch Tomorrow</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/26/freebies-of-a-different-sort-its-taco-time/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Freebies Of A Different Sort: It&#x2019;s Taco Time\">Freebies Of A Different Sort: It&#x2019;s Taco Time</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
