This seems like an awful lot of work for some free food, but we won&#x2019;t judge those who participate. The Cow Appreciation <a href=\"http://cowappreciationday.com/_downloads/cad_faqs.pdf\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/cowappreciationday.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Official Rules</a> state:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For one day only, black and white spots, cow bells and furry ears will be appropriate attire in the nation&#x2019;s second largest chicken. In celebration of July 10, Cow Appreciation Day (an unofficial yet nationally recognized holiday), Chick-fil-A will award a free combo meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner) to any customer who comes to one of the chain&#x2019;s 1,300-plus restaurants fully dressed as a cow. &#x201C;Fully dressed as a cow&#x201D; means an effort to be dressed like a cow from head to toe. For customers who want to join us in partial cow attire (such as the cow headband, a cow-printed hat, vest or purse) a free entr&#xE9;e will be given.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The &#x201C;partial cow attire&#x201D; option sounds particularly attractive to us. Chick-fil-a even provides a helpful <a href=\"http://cowappreciationday.com/_downloads/costume_kit.pdf\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/cowappreciationday.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Starter Kit</a> for the unfortunate cow-costume-less people of America, which provides cow ears and noses and spots and signs so that hungry customers can go all out on Cow Appreciation Day. A+ for creativity, Chick-fil-a!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/11/freebies-with-strings-attached-chick-fil-a/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Freebies With Strings Attached: Chick-Fil-A\">Freebies With Strings Attached: Chick-Fil-A</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/07/sports-fan-score-free-chick-fil-a-today-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sports Fan Score Free Chick Fil A Today [Freebies]\">Sports Fan Score Free Chick Fil A Today [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/27/kentucky-fried-chicken-no-longer-fried-for-free-freebies-wtf/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Kentucky Fried Chicken, No Longer Fried, For Free?
