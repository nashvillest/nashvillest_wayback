We may be seeing calorie information on restaurant menus after all, since <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090702/NEWS0201/907020356/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Governor Phil vetoed a bill yesterday that would&#x2019;ve reversed the Metro Board of Health&#x2019;s decision to require it</a> a few months ago. And why did he veto it? Because <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/01/another-year-another-fat-report-mixed-reviews-by-people-who-dont-live-here/\" target=\"_blank\">our state is looking at a 30% obesity rate</a> and the governor feels that if cities want to try to curb that by letting folks know what they&#x2019;re eating, then they should be able to do that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cutting the red tape. </strong>And actually, Governor Phil has been pretty busy lately. Yesterday, he also joined a few other public figures to break ground on <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10629197\" target=\"_blank\">the I-40 overpass near White Bridge that&#x2019;s been in limbo for nearly four years because we didn&#x2019;t have the money to finish it</a>. Thanks to some of the stimulus money, the project might actually happen.</li>\n<li><strong>Soft targets. </strong>Since Green Hills (or at least the Green Hills Mall parking garage) has recently become a hotbed for violent crime, officials are trying to figure out what&#x2019;s going on and how to stop it. At least one contributing factor according to security personnel is that <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/are-green-hills-shoppers-soft-targets-criminals\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;Shoppers in Green Hills are what criminals refer to as a soft target.&#x201D;</a> Heh.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Metro buses are getting fitted with fancy new GPS systems that should make it easier to tell <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10630498\" target=\"_self\">just how absurdly late your bus is going to be</a> &#x2026; All Gannett papers, including the <em>Tennessean</em>, <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/07/scratch_that_gannett_layoffs_m.php\" target=\"_blank\">took another pretty big cut yesterday</a> &#x2026; BNA is <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/07/01/southwest-american-tweak-bna-schedules/\" target=\"_blank\">losing three Southwest flights</a> &#x2026; The Preds&#x2019; Alexander Radulov, who <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9027574\" target=\"_blank\">ran off to Russia last year before his contract was up</a> because he liked Russian hockey better, <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/radulov-wont-return-nashville-coming-season\" target=\"_blank\">won&#x2019;t be re-signing with the Preds</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/chris1051/3679975919/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Chris1051</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/04/bright-early-fat-camp-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Fat Camp Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Fat Camp Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/10/bright-early-you-cant-touch-this-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: You Can&#x2019;t Touch This Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: You Can&#x2019;t Touch This Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
