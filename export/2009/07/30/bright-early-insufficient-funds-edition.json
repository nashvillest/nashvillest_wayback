Imagine going to the bank to cash your paycheck only to find out that your employer is flat broke. Their check bounces, which means your checks bounce and bank fees quickly begin to stack up. That&#x2019;s exactly what happened to <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/money/20217422/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">more than 200 Lebanon city workers this week when the city&#x2019;s bank account appeared to have insufficient funds</a> to pay the employees. It turned out to be a glitch in the system with Bank of America, and Lebanon swears that they&#x2019;re not actually broke. As a result, they&#x2019;ll soon be switching to a local bank and offering direct deposit.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li><strong>Beer on Sundays? </strong>Clarksville is <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10813826\" target=\"_blank\">wrestling with the idea of selling beer on Sundays starting at 6AM&#xA0; just like they do every other day of the week</a>. Some folks anticipate that it could bring the city as much as $80,000 in additional tax revenue, but the local religious community is afraid it&#x2019;ll just give people more time to booze it up.</li>\n<li><strong>Drug bust. </strong>Metro Police <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/marijuana-grow-operation-found-west-nashville\" target=\"_blank\">busted a pretty big marijuana grow operation in West Nashville last night</a>, discovering 41 pot plants hanging out in someone&#x2019;s backyard. They were actually responding to another unrelated call next door when they spotted the plants.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The two Spanish language newspapers in town <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090730/NEWS01/907300349/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">are suing each other</a> &#x2026; Sen.
