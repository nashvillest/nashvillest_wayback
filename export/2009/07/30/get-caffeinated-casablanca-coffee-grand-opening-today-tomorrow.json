Casablanca serves Drew&#x2019;s Brews coffee, Provence pastries, and has a light sandwich menu as well.</p>\n<p>Casablanca soft-opened a week or two ago, but their official grand opening spans today and tomorrow. And what&#x2019;s a grand opening without a great getcha-in-the-door deal? From 8am-10am and 8pm-10pm both today and tomorrow, lattes at Casablanca are just $1. We just can&#x2019;t seem to resist a deal like that, so join us and show a new face some love.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lwy/2198957409/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>LWY</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/27/sudekum-planetarium-grand-opening-moon-walk-anyone/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sudekum Planetarium Grand Opening: Moon Walk, Anyone?\">Sudekum Planetarium Grand Opening: Moon Walk, Anyone?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/17/urban-outfitters-grand-opening-march-26-finally/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Urban Outfitters Grand Opening March 26 (Finally)\">Urban Outfitters Grand Opening March 26 (Finally)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/28/tonight-graces-plaza-wine-spirits-grand-opening/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: Grace&#x2019;s Plaza Wine &amp; Spirits Grand Opening\">Tonight: Grace&#x2019;s Plaza Wine &amp; Spirits Grand Opening</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/10/13/get-your-pinkberry-fix-west-end-grand-opening-thursday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Get Your Pinkberry Fix: West End Grand Opening Thursday\">Get Your Pinkberry Fix: West End Grand Opening Thursday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/07/caffeinated-birthdays-have-your-cake-and-coffee-too/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Caffeinated Birthdays: Have Your Cake And Coffee Too\">Caffeinated Birthdays: Have Your Cake And Coffee Too</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
