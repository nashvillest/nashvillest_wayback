We&#x2019;re guessing that the economy has socked &#x2018;em where it hurts, because the deal is a little less attractive this year.</p>\n<p>Today at The Cheesecake Factory, <a href=\"http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/shareit/shareit\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.thecheesecakefactory.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>dine-in only</strong> guests can enjoy half price slices of cheesecake</a> to celebrate National Cheesecake Day in style. That means you could end up paying $3-4 (and don&#x2019;t forget to tip your server) for your cheesecake, which is a steal in terms of Cheesecake Factory prices, but pretty average everywhere else. It&#x2019;s your call. They&#x2019;re also introducing a new Red Velvet cheesecake today, which just might get us out the door to stand in line for a seat.</p>\n<p>Nashville&#x2019;s only Cheesecake Factory is located in the Mall at Green Hills.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ginnerobot/3271176877/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ginnerobot</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=e4a63a0e-244d-4ba1-88de-853b3b28b3be\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/30/good-enough-almost-free-cheesecake/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Good Enough For Us: Almost-Free Cheesecake\">Good Enough For Us: Almost-Free Cheesecake</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/15/half-price-circus-yes-please-almost-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Half Price Circus?
