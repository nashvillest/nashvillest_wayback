As part of a last-ditch effort to salvage some jobs within Metro, <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/council-amends-budget-save-17-metro-workers\" target=\"_blank\">the city council will be going back over some budget revisions tonight that will hopefully save 17 positions</a>. In order to come up with the extra money, the proposed amendments would shave off some funds from the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and the Country Music Hall of Fame, as well as pulling some additional money from the rainy day fund. And apparently this is the first time in Metro&#x2019;s history that this year&#x2019;s budget is actually less than last year&#x2019;s.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The wrong button. </strong>A legislative aide has been reprimanded by her employer, Sen. Diane Black, for <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleistalking.com/2009/06/sen-diane-blacks-r-gallatin-legislative-aid-circulates-racist-email/\" target=\"_blank\">sending out a pretty offensive racist email forward from a state computer</a>. She was busted by some bloggers and now the TN Democrats are calling for her to be fired.</li>\n<li><strong>More MNPS shakeups. </strong>Whether or not Metro meets up with NCLB benchmarks, the shakeups have already begun with <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/new-principals-announced-21-metro-schools\" target=\"_blank\">new principals being appointed at 21 different schools</a> within the school system.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090616/NEWS/90616002/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Attendance is way up</a> at the Nashville Zoo, and we blame <a href=\"http://twitter.com/gumu_at_the_zoo\" target=\"_blank\">Gumu</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2009/06/storm-chances-again-hotter/\" target=\"_blank\">More storms today</a>, maybe &#x2026; Being in <em>Newsweek</em>&#x2018;s top 1,500 schools <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090616/COUNTY090101/906160304/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">isn&#x2019;t good enough for Franklin High</a> &#x2026; Franklin&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10537856\" target=\"_blank\">text message crime tips</a> are actually working &#x2026; Archaeologists have <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090615/NEWS01/90615059/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">removed the remains of the Civil War soldier</a> from the ground in Franklin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A year ago on Nashvillest: </strong>Checked out one of the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/nashvillest-spotlight-zingo-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">best ways in town to not get a DUI (or worse?)</a>, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/bright-early-hug-a-sound-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">hugged our Sounds</a>, dreamed of <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/mo-freebies-aw-root-beer-floats/\" target=\"_blank\">free root beer floats</a>, busted some <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/gems-from-the-nashville-craiglist-busted/\" target=\"_blank\">not-so-bright criminals on Craigslist</a>, and <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/happy-hour-bible-belted/\" target=\"_blank\">braced ourselves for the Bible theme park</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasaka/3631561326/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">thomasaka</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
