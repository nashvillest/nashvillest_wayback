Last night was a great night for all the Preds fans out there with<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090619/SPORTS02/906190374/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\"> Steve Sullivan taking home the Bill Masterton trophy for dedication, sportsmanship, and perseverence</a>. Sully made quite a comeback this year after missing two years because of a back injury that required two separate surgeries, racking up 32 points in 41 games this season. Though his future with the Preds is still up in the air right now, at least we know he loves us: &#x201C;From the moment I got there, I&#x2019;ve absolutely fallen in love with Nashville. &#x2026; I can&#x2019;t see us selling our house. We&#x2019;re definitely going to  retire there. I&#x2019;m hoping I can retire there as a player also.&#x201D; Aww.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guns in parks?</strong> They might not be able to keep guns out of bars around town, but the <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10558994\" target=\"_self\">Metro Council is still trying to pass an ordinance keeping them out of our parks</a>.
