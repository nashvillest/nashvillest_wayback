Nashville also has a lot of 5Ks that are also fundraisers, but something about <a href=\"http://elliesrun.org\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/elliesrun.org&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Ellie&#x2019;s Run For Africa</a> stands out amidst the noise. It may have something to do with the fact that Ellie, now fifteen, was just ten years old when she dreamed up the idea for giant fundraiser to help families in Africa meet basic needs. Now in its fifth year, Ellie&#x2019;s Run For Africa is more than just a 5K &#x2013; It&#x2019;s an (early morning) day of fun for families with food, music, dancing, games and more.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Advance registration for Ellie&#x2019;s Run is now closed, but show up bright and early at 6:30am to register on Saturday (and bring the kids for the kiddie fun run too!). 1,000 attendees are expected this year, raising over $100,000.
