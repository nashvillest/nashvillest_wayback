Or rather, take the kids out to Shelby Park tomorrow for the <a href=\"http://nashville.gov/parks/pdfs/nature/WaterFestCatfishRodeo.pdf\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;download&apos;,&apos;nashville.gov/parks/pdfs/nature/WaterFestCatfishRodeo.pdf&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">7th Annual Catfish Rodeo &amp; Water Festival</a>, which coincides with Tennessee&#x2019;s Free Fishing Day. Kids ages 5-16 will be allowed to fish in Shelby Park&#x2019;s Sevier Lake from 8:30am-10:30am, where 2,000 pounds of catfish have helpfully been dumped to ensure that the kiddos will snag a good catch. Bring your own fishing gear, as loaner gear is scarce.</p>\n<p>You may remember the Catfish Rodeo from its prior years in Centennial Park, but its new home at Shelby Park allows it to coincide with the Shelby Bottoms Nature Center&#x2019;s Water Festival, from 10am-2pm. Games,&#xA0;fishing, scavenger hunts, boating and water education activities are all on the agenda for this year.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brent_nashville/398613267/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Brent and MariLynn</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/08/where-have-all-the-catfish-gone-blast-from-the-past/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Where Have All The Catfish Gone?
