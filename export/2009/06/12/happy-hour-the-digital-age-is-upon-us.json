Says Governor Phil: &#x201C;The numbers that they were talking about are well outside of what I think we can do today, in terms of with the budget situation we have. That&#x2019;s not something we&#x2019;ve traditionally done and I don&#x2019;t need to tell you, given the conversation we&#x2019;ve just been having, this is not a year in which I&#x2019;ve got a spare couple hundred million dollars lying around in the rainy day fund for something like this.&#x201D; [<a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10519450\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">WKRN</a>]</li>\n<li>Oh hey, another drug bust en route to Bonnaroo.

Barbara Boxer, who declared the Kingston TVA ash spill to be 100 times worse than Exxon-Valdez, is trying to get the Department of Homeland Security to disclose other coal ash dump sites across the country. Their answer? They can&#x2019;t, because the materials stored inside are dangerous enough to pose a security threat if the wrong folks were to tamper with them (<em>Thanks to Justin C. for the tip!</em>) [<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/12/coal-ash-spills-too-dange_n_214739.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.huffingtonpost.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/29/happy-hour-journalistic-integrity/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Journalistic Integrity\">Happy Hour: Journalistic Integrity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/25/happy-hour-what-a-day-what-a-day/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: What A Day, What A Day\">Happy Hour: What A Day, What A Day</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/19/happy-hour-_________-started-the-fire/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: _________ Started The Fire\">Happy Hour: _________ Started The Fire</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
