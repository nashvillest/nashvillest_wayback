Because your editors have collected a number of parking tickets around town over the years, and we&#x2019;re pretty sure no one has ever stuffed <em>ours</em> into a desk. Either way, the tickets are hiding no more, the clerks in question have been fired, and the 5,000 will soon be receiving letters telling them that they still need to pay up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>This is Amurrica.</strong> On the heels of the whole Guns In Bars bill debacle, the Tennessee Senate just passed another piece of gun legislation that specifies that <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/06/03/tennessee-firearms-freedom-act-passes-senate/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/politics.nashvillepost.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">any gun made completely in Tennessee won&#x2019;t be subject to those pesky federal regulations</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>We can&#x2019;t wait. </strong>A group of dedicated folks are working out a plan to revitalize Centennial Park.

What?), then you&#x2019;ll be happy to know that <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/community/19649579/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wsmv.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">the plan includes adding a place for musicians that &#x201C;will resemble a landmark in England.&#x201D;</a> Awesome.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Knox County Schools have unblocked GLBT websites after being faced with a lawsuit from the ACLU, claiming that the <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/24b9e924-www.fox17.com.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.fox17.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">whole thing was the result of a glitch</a>.
