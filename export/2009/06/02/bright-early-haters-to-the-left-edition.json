We&#x2019;ve been hearing a lot about all the state budget cuts (and local budget cuts, and school budget cuts&#x2026;), but Governor Phil doesn&#x2019;t exactly inspire much confidence by asserting that <a href=\"http://www.theleafchronicle.com/article/20090531/NEWS01/905310336\" target=\"_blank\">&#x201C;it&#x2019;s not like we&#x2019;re slashing state government into ribbons,&#x201D;</a> and inviting us all to &#x201C;blame it all on Bredesen&#x201D; before we&#x2019;ve even had time to assess the damage. Or even his statement to all the haters: &#x201C;Fine, if you want a different revenue source &#x2014; or if you want to cut something else somewhere &#x2014; I&#x2019;ve given you a budget, process it. If you want to change it, change it.&#x201D; We&#x2019;ll spare you the gory details, but you can read about some of the worst of the cuts over <a href=\"http://www.theleafchronicle.com/article/20090531/NEWS01/905310336\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Magical thinking. </strong>Spring Hill GM workers are trying to stay positive about yesterday&#x2019;s announcement that the plant will be idling indefinitely before the end of the year, noting that at least they&#x2019;re not closing for good yet, at least they might have a new product to make (the non-SUV), and it could&#x2019;ve been worse.</li>\n<li><strong>Tut tut, looks like rain.</strong> Nashville racked up a soggy 8.45 inches of rain during the month of May, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/weather/19631801/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">making it the wettest month since September 2003</a>.
