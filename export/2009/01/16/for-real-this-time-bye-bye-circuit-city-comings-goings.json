Reports are pouring in from pretty much everywhere that state that Circuit City has filed for court approval to liquidate its remaining 567 stores.

Last time they liquidated, some <a href=\"http://consumerist.com/5104893/circuit-city-liquidator-doubles-list-price-before-taking-50-off\" target=\"_blank\">shoppers noticed a little bait &amp; switch</a> going on with the prices. Liquidators have been known to go so far as to double the original price on some items before they slap a 30% discount on it. Let the buyer beware!</p>\n<p>If we have to be honest, we really aren&#x2019;t going to miss Circuit City one bit. The selection and service have left quite a bit to be desired for several years now. But this is putting a lot of folks out of a job at a time when a job is what they need the most, and for that, we&#x2019;re very disappointed.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/shelleproductions/3136350335/\" target=\"_blank\">shellEProductions</a>.</em></p>"
