Nevermind that they just spilled a billion gallons of toxic sludge in East Tennessee. Nevermind that they&#x2019;re pumping pollutants over the border into our neighboring state. Nevermind that they&#x2019;re jacking up our prices so much that no one can afford to pay their electricity bills. And nevermind that whenever our bills go up, <a href=\"http://www.wate.com/global/story.asp?s=9275359\" target=\"_blank\">so does the CEO&#x2019;s salary</a>.
