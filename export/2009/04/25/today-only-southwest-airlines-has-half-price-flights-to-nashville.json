We love them for their $98 nonstop flights to Seattle. We love them for bringin’ the party in otherwise boring airport terminals every single holiday.  Anyway, enough about our little crush on Southwest. Yesterday, they offered half-price flights to/from Philadelphia as part of their 4-day Mystery City Sale. And today’s destination? Nashville! […]",

And today&#x2019;s destination? Nashville! So if you have friends or family who keep coming up with excuses not to visit you, well, Southwest is helping you knock those excuses down. Travel must be booked today and is only good for travel through June 10, but we&#x2019;re seeing fares as low as $50 coming in from some cities. And you can use the fares to leave Nashville too, if you so desire.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevharb/3412862148/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kevin H</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>"
