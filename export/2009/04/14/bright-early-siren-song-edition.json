The folks in Rutherford County are still reeling from last week&#x2019;s EF-4 tornado and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10177680\" target=\"_blank\">now wonder whether a siren warning system could&#x2019;ve saved lives</a>. We tend to take our own siren system for granted here in Nashville (especially when we hear it every five minutes for two hours straight), but it&#x2019;s a pretty easy way for the city to tell us that there&#x2019;s a tornado lurking nearby. Rutherford County officials say that they&#x2019;re too broke to pay for something like that, and also that Rutherford is too spread-out to benefit from a siren system. Until then, they say, you&#x2019;ll just have to rely on local news.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shaking things up.</strong> Now that the Preds are out of the playoffs, they&#x2019;re looking to see what might happen with the eight players who could become free agents in July <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090414/SPORTS02/904140358/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">including everyone&#x2019;s favorite&#x2013;Steve Sullivan</a>.
