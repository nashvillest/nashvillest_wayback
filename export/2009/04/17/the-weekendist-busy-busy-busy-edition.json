The 10th Annual Ragin&#x2019; Cajun Crawfish Boil may be a good way to finish off a day of festivals and music (or take a break in the middle, at least).

Okay, we&#x2019;ve been giving Grimey&#x2019;s a lot of love, because they always have the biggest party on the block, but we&#x2019;d hate for everyone to forget about the OTHER independent record stores in town that will be participating in Record Store Day as well. The Great Escape is planning a sidewalk sale, and <a href=\"http://thegroovenashville.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Groove</a> in East Nashville has a pretty impressive party planned too.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/16/vandys-rites-of-spring-ti-nickel-creek-and-flaming-lips-oh-my/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rites of Spring</strong></a>. <em>Vanderbilt Alumni Lawn, 3pm-12am, $40/day or $55/both days</em>.
