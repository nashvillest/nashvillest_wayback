Well, almost. We know it&#x2019;s only Monday, but we wanted to give you a day&#x2019;s notice so you can plan <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">to call in sick</span> your day, because the fun starts early and goes all day tomorrow. So if you&#x2019;re among the unemployed (or just happen to be calling in sick from work, wink wink), count yourself lucky. You&#x2019;re the only ones who will be able to partake in the 11am beer specials! Have fun! And above all else, stay safe, and call a cab or <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/nashvillest-spotlight-zingo-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">Zingo</a> if you&#x2019;re going to be drinking into the wee hours of the night.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://eastnashvillepubcrawls.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The 4th Annual Yazoo Get Lucky East Pub Crawl</strong></a>. <em>7pm-12am, East Nashville&#x2019;s 5 Points</em>. Barhop from 3 Crow Bar to Beyond The Edge to Batter&#x2019;d And Fried to Red Door East with Yazoo, Team Green &amp; Lightning 100. Drink specials and special contests for participants, plus bonus giveaways for those who visit all four bars during the evening. We &lt;3 Yazoo and 5 Points, so this is our top pick for the evening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mcfaddensnashville.com/events-description.php?id=15893\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The 2nd Annual McPatty&#x2019;s Fest</strong></a>. <em>Starts at 1pm (18+ after 10pm), 2nd Avenue downtown</em>. 2nd Ave will be blocked off (so commuters take note) for the party all day, so come and enjoy DJs, giveaways, and beer. And more beer. And did we mention beer? Since this is actually more of a street festival, tickets are $10, but a portion of the proceeds go to Relay For Life.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://riverfronttavern.com/Events/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day At Riverfront Tavern</a></strong>. <em>11am-close, 101 Church St</em>. Listen closely. Green beer starts at $0.25 (that&#x2019;s a quarter!) at 11am and increases in price by $0.25 every hour. We can only imagine the possibilities. And the first 100 people get a free t-shirt. And there&#x2019;s no cover charge. Free + $0.25 beer + free t-shirts seem like a pretty dang good time to us!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/139661\" target=\"_blank\">St. Patty&#x2019;s Pandemonium With Pat Patrick</a></strong>. <em>7pm-close, Limelight</em>. Tickets to this one will cost you a whopping $30 each, but that includes dinner, free parking, and a performance by the Pat Patrick Band (who we&#x2019;ve never really heard of but imagine that they&#x2019;re in high demand on at least one holiday per year).</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/141879\" target=\"_blank\">2009 Southside Irish Parade (&amp; Pub Crawl</a>)</strong>. <em>Starts at 5pm, Past Perfect</em>. The first 50 participants get free kazoos, need we say more? This parade/pub crawl will drag participants down Broadway from Past Perfect to Paradise Park to Broadway Brewhouse to Doc Hollidays. Top it all off with a Wii tournament and free keg party (what, are we in college?) and you&#x2019;ve got yourself a pretty exciting St. Patty&#x2019;s evening.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=1033074\" target=\"_blank\">3rd &amp; Lindsley Celebrates St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day</a></strong>. <em>5pm-close, 3rd &amp; Lindsley</em>. Headlined by The Blair Band, tickets to this party are only $10 and the price includes a beer. Also promised are some Irish dancers, woohoo!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.danmcguinnesspub.com/nashville/calendar.php/month/3/year/2009/day/17/view/grid#12_1237266000\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dan McGuinness Kegs, Eggs &amp; More</strong></a>. <em>8:30am-close, both Dan McGuinness locations</em>. A pint o&#x2019;Guinness and some Irish scrambled eggs for only $9 until 11am, then party all day with free shuttle service between the downtown and Cool Springs locations. $10 cover charge to enjoy live music and great food &amp; drink specials all day.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/greencolander/2678724094/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Greencolander</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/31/1405/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: New Years Eve Procrastinators, Unite!
