Some folks in South Nashville were kind of grossed out when <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9969435\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wkrn.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">the creek behind their home turned bright green last night</a>. Though the Nashville Fire Department seems to think the &#x201C;unidentified substance&#x201D; in the water is some sort of pond dye or food coloring, locals are still concerned that it looks a little too much like antifreeze. And judging by the photos, we can&#x2019;t say we blame them! We&#x2019;re guessing someone will be out to test the water this morning and hopefully it&#x2019;s harmless.
