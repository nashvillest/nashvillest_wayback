But over at the Nashvillest HQ we&#x2019;re actually pretty excited about Daylight Savings, since it means that pretty soon, it might actually be light outside when we leave work every day! We&#x2019;re willing to deal with a 54-hour weekend if that&#x2019;s what it takes.</p>\n<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/nashville/storecalendar.php\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wholefoodsmarket.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>80&#x2019;s Day</strong></a>. <em>12pm-8pm at the Green Hills Whole Foods Market</em>. Um, we don&#x2019;t know about you, but our curiosity often gets the better of us when it comes to things like 80&#x2019;s Days at places like Whole Foods. We&#x2019;re not sure how one can have 80&#x2019;s themed food samples, but we are pretty excited about the paltry $2 charitable donation it will take to fire up the proverbial 80&#x2019;s jukebox and have <em>real </em>Bon Jovi ringing through everyone&#x2019;s ears.

We were a little late on the Blitzen Trapper bandwagon, but ever since we saw them <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/21/this-weekend-iron-wine-with-blitzen-trapper-at-the-ryman/\" target=\"_blank\">open for Iron &amp; Wine</a> a few months ago at The Ryman, we&#x2019;ve been big fans.

Even if you&#x2019;re not a podcaster, come down to PodCamp Nashville on Saturday and hang out with Nashville&#x2019;s tech community. Here&#x2019;s three reasons. #1: You will learn a lot. #2: It will be fun. #3: You will get to meet us.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cmt.com/shows/series/can_you_duet/series.jhtml\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.cmt.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CMT&#x2019;s <em>Can You Duet? </em>Open Casting Call</strong></a>. <em>8am at the Wildhorse Saloon</em>. Pretty self-explanatory, don&#x2019;t you think? Hopefuls must be in line by 12pm to qualify. Meanwhile, we&#x2019;ll be sneaking over during session breaks at PodCamp, because it&#x2019;s bound to be entertaining.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ticketbiscuit.com/exitin/EventPage.aspx?EID=27573&amp;VD=3/1/2009&amp;\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.ticketbiscuit.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Joshua Radin with Meiko and Jesse Harris</strong></a>. <em>8pm at the Exit/In.</em> We&#x2019;ve managed to miss each of these great artists every time they&#x2019;ve passed through town, and we&#x2019;re not letting the chance slip away again. Tickets are $15 in advance or $17 (or $18?) at the door. Joshua Radin&#x2019;s new CD <em>Simple Times </em>is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Times/dp/B001GTRX2M/ref=sr_f3_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1236355289&amp;sr=103-1\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.amazon.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">$1.99 on Amazon MP3</a>, which is a pretty low-cost investment for some new tunes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sugarisart.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.sugarisart.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sugar Is Art Gallery</strong></a>. <em>12pm at the Cannery Ballroom</em>.

Individual tickets go for a cool $250, but why stop there? For only $10,000, you and 15 of your closest friends can choose which Predators player you want to sit with, appear in the Disco Ball video shown at the event, and much, much more. We still can&#x2019;t decide if we want to drop our pocket change on the Disco Ball or <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/04/camp-nashville-country-musics-fantasy-camp/\" target=\"_blank\">Camp Nashville</a> this year&#x2026;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/polanri/94428007/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">polanri</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/21/this-weekend-iron-wine-with-blitzen-trapper-at-the-ryman/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Iron &amp; Wine With Blitzen Trapper At The Ryman\">This Weekend: Iron &amp; Wine With Blitzen Trapper At The Ryman</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/31/this-weekend-celebrate-one-year-with-whole-foods/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Celebrate One Year With Whole Foods\">This Weekend: Celebrate One Year With Whole Foods</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/11/the-weekendist-that-time-of-year-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: &#x201C;That&#x201D; Time Of Year Edition\">The Weekendist: &#x201C;That&#x201D; Time Of Year Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/13/the-weekendist-st-pattys-day-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: St. Patty&#x2019;s Day Edition\">The Weekendist: St. Patty&#x2019;s Day Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/12/this-weekend-miss-martha-gets-crankin-a-little-earlier-this-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Miss Martha Gets Crankin&#x2019; A Little Earlier This Year\">This Weekend: Miss Martha Gets Crankin&#x2019; A Little Earlier This Year</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
