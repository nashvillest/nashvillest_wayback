Juliet). Now, for Rita&#x2019;s newbies, let us explain something. Every year, on the first day of spring, <a href=\"http://ritasice.com/events-and-promotions/first-day-of-spring.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Rita&#x2019;s dishes out free italian ice all day</a>. And we love them dearly for it.</p>\n<p>And ever so conveniently, the first day of spring is today! So hop in the car and take a mini road trip out to Hermitage between noon and 10pm today for some free Rita&#x2019;s Italian Ice. It will change your life. And if anyone wants to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RitasItalianIce/status/1337626899\" target=\"_blank\">franchise a bona fide Nashville location</a>, we&#x2019;d be your biggest fans.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/2820052064/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. T In DC</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/29/our-favorite-freebie-yet-ritas-italian-ice/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Our Favorite Freebie Yet: Rita&#x2019;s Italian Ice\">Our Favorite Freebie Yet: Rita&#x2019;s Italian Ice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/02/19/national-holidays-we-like-free-pancake-free-pretzel-day-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: National Holidays We Like: Free Pancake &amp; Free Pretzel Day [Freebies]\">National Holidays We Like: Free Pancake &amp; Free Pretzel Day [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/18/tomorrow-aw-free-root-beer-float-day-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tomorrow: A&amp;W Free Root Beer Float Day [Freebies]\">Tomorrow: A&amp;W Free Root Beer Float Day [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/20/the-weekendist-first-day-of-spring-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: First Day Of Spring Edition\">The Weekendist: First Day Of Spring Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/05/head-to-the-hermitage-on-friday-for-free-admission-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Head To The Hermitage On Friday For Free Admission [Freebies]\">Head To The Hermitage On Friday For Free Admission [Freebies]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
