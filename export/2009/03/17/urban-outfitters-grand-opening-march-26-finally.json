Anyway, doesn&#x2019;t look like much else is happening that day, but we might drop by at 6:30pm to see Will Hoge play and point and laugh at all the hipsters. Just kidding, we &lt;3 Urban Outfitters just as much as the next person! And we love that they&#x2019;re collecting cans for Second Harvest Food Bank. <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/03/17/nine-days-till-urban-outfitters/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>via Post Business</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/04/urban-outfitters-grand-opening-to-include-will-hoge-sorta-kinda-maybe/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Urban Outfitters Grand Opening To Include Will Hoge (Sorta Kinda Maybe)?\">Urban Outfitters Grand Opening To Include Will Hoge (Sorta Kinda Maybe)?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/17/turnip-truck-urban-fare-opening-in-the-gulch-this-october/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Turnip Truck &#x201C;Urban Fare&#x201D; Opening In The Gulch This October\">Turnip Truck &#x201C;Urban Fare&#x201D; Opening In The Gulch This October</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/30/get-caffeinated-casablanca-coffee-grand-opening-today-tomorrow/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Get Caffeinated: Casablanca Coffee Grand Opening Today &amp; Tomorrow\">Get Caffeinated: Casablanca Coffee Grand Opening Today &amp; Tomorrow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/03/this-weekend-the-most-unfortunately-named-urban-adventure-race-ever/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: The Most Unfortunately Named &#x201C;Urban Adventure&#x201D; Race Ever\">This Weekend: The Most Unfortunately Named &#x201C;Urban Adventure&#x201D; Race Ever</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/27/sudekum-planetarium-grand-opening-moon-walk-anyone/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sudekum Planetarium Grand Opening: Moon Walk, Anyone?\">Sudekum Planetarium Grand Opening: Moon Walk, Anyone?</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
