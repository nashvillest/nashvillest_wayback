And if there&#x2019;s something we&#x2019;re good at over here at Nashvillest, it&#x2019;s snagging deals! We&#x2019;ve rounded up a bunch of the recent recession bargains so that you can save a buck or two on your everyday expenses. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but rather, a good starting place (we couldn&#x2019;t possibly round up EVERY deal in town!). <strong>Know of more great recession deals? Drop us an <a href=\"mailto:tips@nashvillest.com\" target=\"_blank\">email</a> or leave a comment, and we&#x2019;ll update the list and credit you! </strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/03/11/carmike-cuts-us-a-break-1-popcorn-and-drinks/\" target=\"_blank\">Carmike Cinemas&#x2019; Stimulus Tuesday (and new $1.50 theater)</a>.<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Get a small popcorn and a small drink for a buck each on Tuesdays at all Carmike Cinemas.
