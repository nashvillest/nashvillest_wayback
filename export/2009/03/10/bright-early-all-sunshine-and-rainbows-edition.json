When it comes to the TVA spewing their toxic ash everywhere, the federal Environmental Protection Agency says that help is on the way. Thanks to that coal ash disaster back in December, the EPA <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090310/NEWS02/903100349/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">has decided to check out more than 300 ash pounds all across the country to make sure they won&#x2019;t be &#x201C;pulling a Kingston.&#x201D;</a> Though the folks at the TVA are in the process of stepping up their own regulation (ha, ha) the feds believe it&#x2019;s time for some federal oversight to make sure that all of the country&#x2019;s coal plants are doing it right. And in case you missed it last week, &#x201C;problems were identified&#x201D; at a fourth TVA ash pond in New Johnsonville.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li><strong>It&#x2019;s the start of something new.</strong> Some potentially exciting changes are in store for Nashville&#x2019;s bus system (did we really just say that?) that could include <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090310/NEWS01/903100346/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">new buses, better shelters, and real-time schedule updates</a>. If all goes as planned, Nashville could be getting $14M in stimulus money for mass transit and Murfreesboro could be looking at $2.1 to spruce up their ROVER bus system. May our buses always <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/29/mta-jingle-contest-its-ready-to-roll-only-in-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">live up to their jingle</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>New czar! </strong>And speaking of stimulus things, Governor Phil has named former assistant to the Comptroller Charles L. Harrison as <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=66677\" target=\"_blank\">the fancy new Stimulus Czar of Tennessee</a>, which sort of sounds like he should be carrying around a bejeweled staff and hoarding gold bricks.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The $8,000 painting accidentally donated to Goodwill has <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090310/NEWS01/903100348/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">finally sold for real for $7,500</a> &#x2026; Families in Nashville have opinions <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090310/NEWS01/903100362/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">about the stem cell debate</a> &#x2026; Way to go to the TNGOP for getting their super-clever <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/03/tn_gop_makes_national_news_for.php\" target=\"_blank\">HONK IF YOU&#x2019;RE PAYING MY MORTGAGE</a> bumper sticker onto The View &#x2026; As WKRN says, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2009/03/10/hot-then-storms-then-cold/\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Then Storms Then Cold.</a>&#x201D; Booo cold &#x2026; Tennessean woman <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090310/OPINION02/90309035/1053\" target=\"_blank\">protests bacon</a>, comment storm ensues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/greystgirl/3342922546/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Grey Street Girl</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/01/bright-early-we-kind-of-hate-april-fools-day-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: We Kind Of Hate April Fools Day Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: We Kind Of Hate April Fools Day Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/16/bright-early-being-green-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Being Green Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Being Green Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/14/happy-hour-the-david-briley-show/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: The David Briley Show!\">Happy Hour: The David Briley Show!</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
