Nashville, here&#x2019;s the thing. Every month, we tell you to buy your tickets in advance. And every month, we&#x2019;ve got someone whining to us that they didn&#x2019;t get in at the door. Roller derby is no longer the underground event that it once was, if <a href=\"http://www.nashvillegab.com/2009/03/nicole-kidman-enjoys-blood-sports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Kidman showing up to a recent Nashville bout</a> wasn&#x2019;t enough of a clue. So please, get your tickets ahead of time and spare yourself the anguish of sending us a whiny tweet. Please.</p>\n<p>Also of note: Our Rollergirls are ranked 7th in the South Central division, their first time in the top 10, which also gives them a great shot at going to the regional tournaments this September. We&#x2019;re crossing our fingers for them to break into the top 5, so come on out to show them some love.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brownpapertickets.com/producerevent/52450?prod_id=3430\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nashville Rollergirl All-Stars vs. Huntsville Dixie Derby Girls</strong></a>. Saturday, May 16, 7pm. Tickets are $10 or $15 at the door (but what did we tell you about that door?!).</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/09/saturday-nashville-rollergirls-back-at-home-to-take-on-new-orleans/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans\">Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/20/nashville-rollergirls-kick-off-another-derby-season-at-municipal-auditorium-this-saturday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Rollergirls Kick Off Another Derby Season At Municipal Auditorium This Saturday\">Nashville Rollergirls Kick Off Another Derby Season At Municipal Auditorium This Saturday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/15/saturday-see-the-soon-to-be-homeless-rollergirls-close-the-2009-season/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saturday: See The Soon-To-Be-Homeless Rollergirls Close The 2009 Season\">Saturday: See The Soon-To-Be-Homeless Rollergirls Close The 2009 Season</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/03/last-chance-to-get-your-roller-derby-fix-this-weekend-this-year-at-least/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Last Chance To Get Your Roller Derby Fix This Weekend (This Year, At Least)\">Last Chance To Get Your Roller Derby Fix This Weekend (This Year, At Least)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/16/dont-miss-this-last-chance-to-brave-the-roller-derby/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Last Chance To Brave The Roller Derby\">Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Last Chance To Brave The Roller Derby</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
