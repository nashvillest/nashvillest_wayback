Something about Elvis&#x2026; and enchiladas? Anyway, Chuy&#x2019;s has signed a lease in Cool Springs in what used to be the old Beethoven&#x2019;s Grille (near Mallory &amp; Cool Springs Blvd. intersection), and we have a feeling that many Texan transplants are going to be dancing with joy at their arrival. And as for us, we were sold after reading the vivid description on <a href=\"http://www.chuys.com\" target=\"_blank\">Chuys.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"style5\">Scream        &#x2019;til your daddy stops here.

They even gave us temporary Chuy&#x2019;s tattoos! We&#x2019;ll keep you updated with more details about their opening, and join the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=50698449228\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook group</a> or their <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chuys-Nashville/81925186839\" target=\"_blank\">official Facebook page</a> for up to date info as well. <em>Thanks to Brad Beatty for the updates</em>!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/carlos/535159/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuevo Anden</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/04/clear-the-roads-cool-springs-chuys-open-for-business-and-heading-for-the-boro/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Clear The Roads, Cool Springs: Chuy&#x2019;s Open For Business (And Heading For The &#x2018;Boro)\">Clear The Roads, Cool Springs: Chuy&#x2019;s Open For Business (And Heading For The &#x2018;Boro)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/12/for-real-this-time-pinkberry-coming-to-nashville-and-cool-springs/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: For Real, This Time: Pinkberry Coming To Nashville, Cool Springs\">For Real, This Time: Pinkberry Coming To Nashville, Cool Springs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/02/17/chuys-aficionados-rejoice-creamy-jalapeno-coming-to-midtown/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Chuy&#x2019;s Aficionados, Rejoice: Creamy Jalape&#xF1;o Coming To Midtown\">Chuy&#x2019;s Aficionados, Rejoice: Creamy Jalape&#xF1;o Coming To Midtown</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/19/cool-springs-wild-oats-morphs-into-whole-foods-today/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Cool Springs Wild Oats Morphs Into Whole Foods Today\">Cool Springs Wild Oats Morphs Into Whole Foods Today</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/31/this-american-life-graces-cool-springs-with-their-presence/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: &#x201C;This American Life&#x201D; Graces Cool Springs With Their Presence\">&#x201C;This American Life&#x201D; Graces Cool Springs With Their Presence</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
