A high school graduation downtown turned tragic when a gunman opened fire into the crowd of 4,000 people who were attending the ceremony. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090519/NEWS03/905190351/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">One person was killed and another injured by the gunfire, and another person was trampled by the crowd running out of the auditorium</a>; none of them were graduates. The Maplewood High School commencement was being held at TSU&#x2019;s Gentry Center and no one has figured out yet why the guy started shooting at people, though a suspect believed to be the shooter was picked up around 8:30 last night near Hadley Park.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abortion amendment passes, sort of. </strong>The abortion amendment, SJR127, <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/05/sjr127_rolls_through_house_wit.php\" target=\"_blank\">passed with flying colors in the House yesterday</a> and at least one person is <a href=\"http://lastcar.blogspot.com/2009/05/sjr127_18.html\" target=\"_blank\">really happy about it</a>.
