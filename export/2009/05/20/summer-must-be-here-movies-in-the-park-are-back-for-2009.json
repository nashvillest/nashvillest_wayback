If you&#x2019;ve lived in Nashville for at least a year, you&#x2019;re probably familiar with the Nashville Scene&#x2019;s Movies In The Park. It&#x2019;s one of our favorite things about summer in Nashville, though it&#x2019;s become so popular that it&#x2019;s hard to find a spot to sit! This year&#x2019;s Movies In The Park runs every Wednesday from May 27 (that&#x2019;s next week!) through June 24, and we&#x2019;re pretty excited for the films they&#x2019;ve picked this year (don&#x2019;t judge us).</p>\n<p>May 27: <a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/147633\" target=\"_blank\">Mamma Mia</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">June 3: </span><span><a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/147869\" target=\"_blank\">Kung Fu Panda</a> </span>Cancelled and rescheduled for July 1</p>\n<p>June 10: <a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/147871\" target=\"_blank\">Bill &amp; Ted&#x2019;s Excellent Adventure</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">June 17: </span><span><a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/147873\" target=\"_blank\">Mean Girls</a> Cancelled and rescheduled for July 8</span></p>\n<p>June 24: <a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/detail/147875\" target=\"_blank\">Batman</a></p>\n<p>July 1: Kung Fu Panda</p>\n<p>July 8: Mean Girls</p>\n<p>Movies are free, all ages (at parental discretion, of course) and start in Centennial Park on Wednesday evenings at sunset, which is usually around 7pm. Last year things got very crowded, so show up early with a blanket to stake out a good spot. We&#x2019;ll see you there!</p>\n<p><em>Photo (not of Nashville) by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/moeview/603117863/\" target=\"_blank\">MOEVIEW is AaronMolina</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/05/10/movies-in-the-park-2011-lineup-includes-500-days-of-summer-harry-potter-ferris-buellers-day-off-more/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Movies In The Park 2011: 500 Days Of Summer, Harry Potter, Ferris Bueller&#x2019;s Day Off &amp; More\">Movies In The Park 2011: 500 Days Of Summer, Harry Potter, Ferris Bueller&#x2019;s Day Off &amp; More</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/21/movies-in-the-park-2010-kicks-off-june-2-with-where-the-wild-things-are/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;\">Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/02/schools-out-free-summer-movies-for-kids/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids\">School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/20/more-than-movies-in-the-park-this-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Than Movies In The Park This Year\">More Than Movies In The Park This Year</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/05/13/the-belcourt-makes-summer-magical-with-free-outdoor-cinema/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Belcourt Knocks Summer Out Of The Park: Free Outdoor Cinema, Eight First Run Films &amp; More\">The Belcourt Knocks Summer Out Of The Park: Free Outdoor Cinema, Eight First Run Films &amp; More</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
