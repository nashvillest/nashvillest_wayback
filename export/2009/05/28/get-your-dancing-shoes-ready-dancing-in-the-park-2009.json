There are still plenty more evening dancing dates in Centennial Park to sate our desire for a good sweaty outdoor dancing romp with strangers!&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tangonashville.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tango at Twilight</a> works like this: From 8-8:30pm, there&#x2019;s a short tango lesson to learn the basics of the Argentinean tango. Then, take your newfound tango skillz to the big time, because from 8:30-10pm is the actual Dance Social. It&#x2019;s free, all ages and skill levels are welcome, and it&#x2019;s really just a big party in the park on Tango at Twilight nights.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The second Tango at Twilight is tomorrow night at the Centennial Park event shelter, with dates every other Friday from there (<strong>5/29, 6/12, 6/26, 7/10, 7/24, 8/14, 8/28</strong>).</p>\n<p>The summer&#x2019;s other outdoor dance events are <a href=\"http://www.dancenashville.com/events.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Band Dances</a>, and they work pretty much the same way as Tango at Twilight. Short dance lessons are from 7:30-8pm and from 8:30-8:50pm on Big Band Dance nights, with open dancing from 7:30-10pm. They&#x2019;re held every Saturday beginning June 6 in the Centennial Park event shelter, and have become a great community event every year. Big Band Dances cover a broad variety of dance styles, are also free, and families are welcomed. This year&#x2019;s schedule is:</p>\n<p><strong>June 6</strong>:&#xA0;&#xA0;The Moonlighters Big Band&#xA0;(Rumba)<br>\n<strong> June 13</strong>:&#xA0;&#xA0;Bill Sleeter Band&#xA0; (Rumba)<br>\n<strong> June 20</strong>: Radio Daze Big Band (Swing)<br>\n<strong> June 27</strong>: Music City Swing (Swing)<br>\n<strong> July 11</strong>: Stardust (ChaCha)<br>\n<strong> July 18</strong>: The Moonlighters Big Band (ChaCha)<br>\n<strong> July 25</strong>:&#xA0;Merchants of Cool (Foxtrot)<br>\n<strong> August 1</strong>: The Usual Suspects (Foxtrot)<br>\n<strong> August 8</strong>: Radio Daze Big Band (Tango)<br>\n<strong> August 15</strong>: Debbie Bailes Band (Tango)<br>\n<strong> August 22</strong>: Music City Swing (Waltz)<br>\n<strong> August 29</strong>: The Moonlighters Big Band (Waltz)</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blueshoe/222615479/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Jon Erickson</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>"
