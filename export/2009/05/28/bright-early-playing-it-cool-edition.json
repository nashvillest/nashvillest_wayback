The June 1 deadline for bankruptcy filing is closing in quickly for GM, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10433323\" target=\"_blank\">whose stocks have fallen a painful 15% since yesterday morning</a>. In the meantime, GM officials are working on a restructuring plan that <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10419426\" target=\"_blank\">could completely shut down the manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, eliminating thousands of jobs</a>. Though Congressman Jim Cooper seems pretty confident that Spring Hill won&#x2019;t be affected, everyone else is preparing for the worst.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cosmotell-what?</strong> Congrats to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090528/NEWS04/905280329/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_self\">St. Bernard Academy 7th grader  Madeline Embrey who made it much farther in the Scripps National Spelling Bee than we ever could</a>. Unfortunately she missed out on the final round after coming up slightly short on a written test, but she can still spell &#x201C;cosmotelluria&#x201D; and we don&#x2019;t even know what that means.</li>\n<li><strong>Diff&#x2019;rent strokes for diff&#x2019;rent folks. </strong>A Donelson Christian Academy student&#x2019;s parents are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10435096\" target=\"_blank\">probably withdrawing their kid from the school after they found the book <em>Jackie and Me</em> on the student&#x2019;s assigned reading list</a>. The book talks about baseball legend Jackie Robinson and his experience with racism in the 1940s while using some colorful but probably historically accurate language.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090528/NEWS0201/905280340/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee Ethics Commission is probably going to expire</a> in June, for real, because who needs ethics anyway? &#x2026; Mayor Dean continues to talk about how we <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090528/NEWS01/905280341/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">really, really need better regional mass transit</a> &#x2026; Fort Campbell still <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/05/27/fort-campbell-leads-army-in-suicides/\" target=\"_blank\">leads the Army in suicides</a>, averaging about one suicide per week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallingwater123/3559854222/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">fallingwater123</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/09/bright-early-playing-with-fire-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Playing With Fire Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Playing With Fire Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
