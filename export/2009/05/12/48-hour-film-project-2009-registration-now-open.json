The team fee is $135 through June 22, but don&#x2019;t wait that long to sign up &#x2013; Registration is first come, first served, and latecoming teams will be placed on a waiting list. The 48 Hour Film Project is growing by leaps and bounds, expanding to nearly 80 cities worldwide this year!</p>\n<p>We participated in 2006 (which we hope you can&#x2019;t find on YouTube) and it was certainly an unforgettable experience. We didn&#x2019;t sleep, but we did eat (a lot) and we even had an appropriately theatrical dash to turn in our film at the very last moment.
