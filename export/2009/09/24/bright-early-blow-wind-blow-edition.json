Juliet police made a $250,000 cocaine bust yesterday on I-40 in Mt. Juliet.</a> The suspect was pulled over for speeding only a few hours after another vehicle traveling with it was also pulled over in West Nashville. The eight kilos of cocaine&#x2013;almost 18 pounds&#x2013;were found tucked away in the car&#x2019;s spare tire along with close to $900 in cash. The vehicles are thought to have been carting the drugs from Texas to Washington, DC, probably for Marion Barry (okay, probably not.)</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li><strong>This is our angry face.</strong> Kings Island theme park in Ohio has officially <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32990627/ns/local_news-nashville_tn/\" target=\"_blank\">ditched its plans to include Steve McNair and Sahel Kazemi skeletons in its Halloween display</a> after they were flooded with complaints.
