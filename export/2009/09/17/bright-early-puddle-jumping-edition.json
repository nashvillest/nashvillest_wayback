Thanks to a few solid days of rain, most of the state has either flooded or probably will flood within 24-48 hours. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11144865\" target=\"_blank\">Cookeville saw six inches of rain yesterday, causing Putnam County Schools to close early</a>, and we&#x2019;re not sure how much rain we got here in Davidson County but we&#x2019;re feeling pretty soggy this morning. Weather forecasts indicate that <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11147289\" target=\"_blank\">it won&#x2019;t be letting up anytime soon and will likely continue on well into the weekend</a>.
