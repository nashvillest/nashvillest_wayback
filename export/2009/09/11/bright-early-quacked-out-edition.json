Thanks to all who came out to <a href=\"http://www.twestivalnashville.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twestival Nashville</a> last night and showed support for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Middle Tennessee. We ate, we drank, we put on a duck costume, we gave away some sweet prizes, and most importantly we raised a pretty good chunk of change for some kids in our community. We&#x2019;ve got a few more days to adopt, so if you haven&#x2019;t already, stop over at the <a href=\"http://www.twestivalnashville.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twestival Nashville</a> website for some important instructions on how to participate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Way to disappoint.</strong> Unfortunately, the Titans didn&#x2019;t have quite as good a night as we did and <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/steelers-top-titans-overtime\" target=\"_blank\">lost to the Steelers 13-10 in overtime</a>. Better luck next time, guys.</li>\n<li><strong>Piece of the pie.</strong> Metro Schools are <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/metro-gets-piece-180m-state-school-bonds\" target=\"_blank\">getting more than $21 million in state bond proceeds directly from the federal government</a>. Although it&#x2019;s only about half of what Memphis schools were given, both school systems apparently rank in the top 100 school districts in the country for children living below the poverty level.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>NES and Metro <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090911/NEWS03/909110341/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">being sued for racial discrimination</a> by twenty employees and past applicants &#x2026; A <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/34c0e951-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">section of I-440W will be closing again</a> this weekend &#x2026; <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/09/10/former-belmont-president-dead-at-95/\" target=\"_blank\">Former Belmont President Herbert Gabhart passed away</a> yesterday at age 95.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweetvenus/3908198937/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">sweetvenus</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
