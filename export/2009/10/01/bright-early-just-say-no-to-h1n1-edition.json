Unlike several other states, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11236016\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee won&#x2019;t be requiring any of its residents to be vaccinated for H1N1</a>. The first batches of the vaccine are set to arrive in our state next week but will go to high-risk professionals such as hospitals and health care providers. The next round will be reserved for pregnant women, small children, and young adults. Everyone else should be able to receive it at the end of this month or in early November.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Concern over Tent City</strong>.

They say that residents are returning and <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/tent-city-dwellers-return-despite-plans-evict\" target=\"_blank\">despite the 18% decrease in crime in the Central Precinct, crime is up by 21% around the encampment</a>. Metro Councilman Erik Cole maintains that repeated arrests aren&#x2019;t effective without the appropriate support services in place.</li>\n<li><strong>Healthcare costs on the rise.</strong> A new study shows that <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/09/30/tennessees-worst-case-health-care-tab/\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee&#x2019;s healthcare costs could increase by 67% by 2019 in the worst-case scenario</a> if there is no systemic reform.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Another chemical spill at the CSX train yard in South Nashville overnight <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/21168482/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">injured one worker</a> &#x2026; Enjoy the nice weather today because it&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/?p=10240\" target=\"_blank\">going to be raining again tomorrow</a> &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/21168396/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">West End Panera butt-grabber</a> has fessed up to his deeds &#x2026; The inmate who claimed that a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091001/NEWS03/910010335/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Davidson County sheriff stole his prosthetic leg</a> has settled with the department for $5,000 &#x2026; Mechelle McNair is seeking permission to<a href=\"http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2009/9/30/mcnair_estate_to_divest_closed_restaurant\" target=\"_blank\"> sell her late husband&#x2019;s 80% share</a> in the Gridiron 9 restaurant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanwoodchuck/3971114232/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>urbanwoodchuck</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/24/bright-not-so-early-what-about-tent-city-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; (Not So) Early: What About Tent City Edition\">Bright &amp; (Not So) Early: What About Tent City Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/13/bright-early-setting-up-camp-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Setting Up Camp Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Setting Up Camp Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
