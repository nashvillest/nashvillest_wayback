Cheekwood, normally $10 at the door, i<a href=\"http://www.cheekwood.org/Visitors/Hours_and_Admission.aspx\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.cheekwood.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">s free this Saturday and Sunday</a>. Saturday hours are 9:30am-4:30pm and Sunday hours are 11am-4:30pm.</p>\n<p>And to make things even more fun, Cheekwood has a fall display of 65 scarecrows scattered around the gardens. We&#x2019;re planning a fall weekend full of apple picking, scarecrow-hunting and pumpkin spice lattes &#x2013; who&#x2019;s with us?</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/eawb/44524746/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>EAWB</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/25/cheekwood-the-frist-host-free-days-this-weekend-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Cheekwood, The Frist Host Free Days This Weekend [Freebies]\">Cheekwood, The Frist Host Free Days This Weekend [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/23/free-frist-more-this-saturday-for-smithsonian-magazine-museum-day/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Play Tourist For Free This Weekend At Frist Center, Cheekwood &amp; More\">Play Tourist For Free This Weekend At Frist Center, Cheekwood &amp; More</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/29/today-free-admission-to-cheekwood-for-wildflowers-40th-birthday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Today: Free Admission To Cheekwood For Wildflowers&#x2019; 40th Birthday\">Today: Free Admission To Cheekwood For Wildflowers&#x2019; 40th Birthday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/10/20/chihuly-at-cheekwood-gets-encore-free-day-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Chihuly At Cheekwood Gets Encore, Free Day [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Chihuly At Cheekwood Gets Encore, Free Day [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/28/cheekwoods-summer-saturdays-twitter-nights-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Cheekwood&#x2019;s Summer Saturdays &amp; Twitter Nights [Freebies]\">Cheekwood&#x2019;s Summer Saturdays &amp; Twitter Nights [Freebies]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
