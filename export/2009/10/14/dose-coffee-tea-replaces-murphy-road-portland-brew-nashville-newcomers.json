New owners Heath Henley and Keith Steunebrink, both former employees of Portland Brew, have spiffed the place up with a new coat of paint, some shiny new lights, a modified seating arrangement and interior flow, and the new sign announcing the arrival of&#xA0;<strong><a href=\"http://dosecoffeeandtea.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;dosecoffeeandtea.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Dose Coffee &amp; Tea</a> </strong>will be installed this week.</p>\n<p>In addition to a fresh face-scrubbing and the name change, the new/old coffee shop will keep offerings that Portland Brew fans have grown to love, and improve on the concept with a few tricks of their own. Look for a new lunch menu coming this month, and in the meantime, a bounty of fresh baked goods are pouring forth from co-tenant <a href=\"http://marmellatabakery.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;marmellatabakery.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Marmellata Bakery</a>. Dose will also begin roasting their own coffee at <a href=\"http://www.mstcoffee.com\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.mstcoffee.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">MST Coffee Roasters</a> in the near future, and will have a variety of coffees from local, regional, national and potentially international roasters available on the shelves for purchase. Henley compares their plans for coffee offerings to that of a wine shop, but on a smaller scale.</p>\n<p>Dose Coffee &amp; Tea will initially retain Portland Brew&#x2019;s hours of 7am-7pm Monday through Saturday, with plans to open on Sunday after renovations are completed in mid-to-late November.
