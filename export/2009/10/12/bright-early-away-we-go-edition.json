When we were sifting through the headlines this morning and came across <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091012/FEATURES01/910120311/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">this article about cuddle parties hitting Middle Tennessee</a>, we have to admit we were almost too creeped out to write about anything else. The parties, which have apparently been a big hit in Murfreesboro lately, are a chance for adults to get together in their pajamas and eat snacks while &#x201C;freestyle cuddling&#x201D; and stacking themselves into &#x201C;puppy piles&#x201D; and giving each other foot massages. Cuddle lifeguards hang around to make sure the fun stays clean, and there is a strict set of rules for each party.
