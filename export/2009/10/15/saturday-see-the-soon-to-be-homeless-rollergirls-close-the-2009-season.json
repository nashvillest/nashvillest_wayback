Our Rollergirls are looking for a new home, as the clock ticks away to June 30, 2010, when the Tennessee State Fairgrounds will close down. If you&#x2019;re hiding a moderately-sized sports arena in your backyard and wish to play host to the roller derby, or if you know of someone who does, drop them a line at <a href=\"mailto:%20nashville.rollergirls@gmail.com\">nashville.rollergirls@gmail.com</a>.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned, Saturday&#x2019;s bout is the last of the 2009 season, so grab your tickets and come out to see the X-Pistols take on the Assault Rivals this weekend. This season&#x2019;s bouts have been selling out, but you can still get tickets at a number of retail locations or online <a href=\"https://www.brownpapertickets.com/producer/3430/index.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.brownpapertickets.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/20/nashville-rollergirls-kick-off-another-derby-season-at-municipal-auditorium-this-saturday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Rollergirls Kick Off Another Derby Season At Municipal Auditorium This Saturday\">Nashville Rollergirls Kick Off Another Derby Season At Municipal Auditorium This Saturday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/09/saturday-nashville-rollergirls-back-at-home-to-take-on-new-orleans/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans\">Saturday: Nashville Rollergirls Back At Home To Take On New Orleans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/14/nashville-rollergirls-at-home-again-nashvillest-psa-it-will-sell-out-dummies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Rollergirls Last Home Bout [Nashvillest PSA]: It Will Sell Out, Dummies\">Nashville Rollergirls Last Home Bout [Nashvillest PSA]: It Will Sell Out, Dummies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/03/last-chance-to-get-your-roller-derby-fix-this-weekend-this-year-at-least/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Last Chance To Get Your Roller Derby Fix This Weekend (This Year, At Least)\">Last Chance To Get Your Roller Derby Fix This Weekend (This Year, At Least)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/16/dont-miss-this-last-chance-to-brave-the-roller-derby/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Last Chance To Brave The Roller Derby\">Don&#x2019;t Miss This: Last Chance To Brave The Roller Derby</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
