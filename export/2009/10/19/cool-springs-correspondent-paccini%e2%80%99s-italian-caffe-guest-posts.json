Below is the original guest post in its entirety. </strong></p>\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note #2: Jeff Goins is a transplant Nashvillian working in nonprofit marketing; he loves reading, writing, and tinkering around on the guitar. You can find him blogging at </em><a style=\"color: #0000cc;\" href=\"http://jeffgoins.myadventures.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pilgrimage of the Heart </em></a><em> or at his </em><a style=\"color: #0000cc;\" href=\"http://goinswriter.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>writing site</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>In a town full of aspiring artists, a good, indie coffee shop is a necessity. Not too pretentious, and yet not too sloppy. Comfy, but also trendy. Those are the requirements (especially if you rely on such establishments for a free, creative work space).</p>\n<p>In the epic quest for satisfying one&#x2019;s caffeine addiction with style, there are three essentials: 1) really good coffee, 2) great ambience (which includes wireless internet for the wandering freelancer), and 3) affordable food (so that you don&#x2019;t have to go home for lunch or spend the day pretending it&#x2019;s Ramadan).</p>\n<p>Whether you&#x2019;re a starving musician or a businessperson looking for a break from the cubicle, <a href=\"www.pacciniscoffee.com&#x2028; \" target=\"_blank\">Paccini&#x2019;s Italian Cafe</a> is a great place to park your laptop and chug some java. Started in the spring of 2008, Paccini&#x2019;s serves locally hand-roasted <a href=\"http://www.drewsbrewscoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drew&#x2019;s Brews Coffee</a> and Intelligentsia tea. The drinks are great, the food&#x2019;s affordable and delicious, and the wifi is free and fast.</p>\n<p>Located on Meridian Boulevard off of Carothers in the Cool Springs area of Franklin with a host of other hip joints (like Bosco&#x2019;s and Noshville), Paccini&#x2019;s is in good company (and high competition). It continues to make a name for itself as both a casual and fun place to hang, eat, and chat at a surprisingly affordable price.</p>\n<p>The comfy couches and chairs, along with your usual cadre of board games and used books make it a typical caf&#xE9; environment; however, Paccini&#x2019;s sets itself apart from other contenders with its high-quality, local brews and extra room for meal-time traffic (unlike your local Mermaid-sponsored caf&#xE9;). Also open in the evenings, it&#x2019;s the perfect locale for an after-dinner espresso drink, accompanied by live music.</p>\n<p>Aside from the coffee, fun ambience, and snappy internet connection, Paccini&#x2019;s has great paninis that refuse to disappoint. Unless you&#x2019;re really hungry, a half sandwich (priced at a whopping $3) is enough for a meal (it comes with chips). Compared to nearly identical lunch offerings around the corner, these are a steal. Whoever thought that robbery could be so delicious?</p>\n<p>Paccini&#x2019;s is well worth checking out. My only complaints are that their hours seem to have been sporadic lately and that they don&#x2019;t really have much of a website yet (a downer for those of us who&#x2019;ve forgotten how to use a phonebook). Oh yeah, and no free refills, but that&#x2019;s just because they respect the coffee too much not to charge for each cup.</p>\n<p>Next time you visit, tell &#x2018;em Jeff sent you (they will probably stare at you blankly, so you better be ready to order something).</p>\n<p><em>Editor&#x2019;s Note: Jeff Goins is a transplant Nashvillian working in nonprofit marketing; he loves reading, writing, and tinkering around on the guitar.
