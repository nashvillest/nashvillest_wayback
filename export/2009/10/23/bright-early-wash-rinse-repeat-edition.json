The Jefferson Street Freedom Riders mural will be getting yet another coat of paint just two weeks after being repainted to cover up where vandals had whited out all of the black faces. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091023/NEWS01/910230347/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">This time around, which is actually the third time someone has defaced the mural since it was finished on May 14th, the painting was found to be covered in a layer of graffiti</a>. Though the vandalism and cleanups are getting tiresome and expensive, the neighborhood insists they&#x2019;ll be repainting it. The mural was originally created by local artists and high school students to celebrate the rich civil rights history of the Jefferson Street neighborhood.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adding fuel to the fire.</strong> Metro Councilman Ronnie Steine is <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091023/NEWS0202/910230349/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">pretty livid about the Parks &amp; Recreation department&#x2019;s slip-up that caused them to overspend by $1 million</a>. He worked up a &#x201C;sternly worded letter&#x201D; demanding that both the parks director and chair of the Metro Finance Committee appear before the council and explain why the mess even happened so that corrective actions can be taken.</li>\n<li><strong>He has a plan.</strong> Former senator Bill Frist <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/frist-releases-plan-improve-schools\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">thinks he has come up with a way that Tennessee schools can become #1 in the southeast despite the fact that they currently sit at #41 nationwide</a>. Frist had &#xA0;a task force gather information and create 60 recommendations for how they might achieve this, insisting that the plan will work if followed.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The TVA is building an overlook <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/39d248e5-www.fox17.com.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.fox17.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">so that citizens can watch the cleanup</a>, which is probably like watching paint dry &#x2026; Keith Urban&#x2019;s benefit &#x201C;All For The Hall&#x201D; benefit for the Country Music Hall of Fame<a href=\"http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2009/10/22/were-all-for-the-hall-benefit-raises-more-than-500000/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;blogs.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"> raised &#xA0;a whopping $500,000</a> &#x2026; Hey, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/frantic-finish-ends-predators-losing-streak\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">the Preds didn&#x2019;t los</a>e! &#x2026; Tennessee <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/10/22/states-construction-job-losses-among-worst-in-country/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;business.nashvillepost.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">ranks among the highest in construction job losses</a> this year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnlamb/2210440932/in/pool-nashvillest/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>John Lamb</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
