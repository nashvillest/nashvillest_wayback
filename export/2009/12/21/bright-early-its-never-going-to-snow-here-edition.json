We hope you survived Snowpocalypse 2009, though we didn&#x2019;t experience a whole lot of wintery weather worth writing home about here in Middle Tennessee. Our neighbors to the east, however, were a different story. Up in the northeastern corner of the state, <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/3cd61c9e-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Scott County emergency personnel are still working to repair some of the worst winter storm damage they&#x2019;ve ever seen</a>. With trees and power lines down along with numerous road closures, they say it could be a week or more before they can get the county back up and running. The storm also <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11706622\" target=\"_blank\">kept a lot of Tennessee travelers from making their holiday escapes with dozens of grounded flights and interstate closures</a>. <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/\" target=\"_blank\">Another big snow storm is forecasted for the coming week</a> but should stay in the midwest. We&#x2019;re keeping our fingers crossed!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Case closed.</strong> Six months after former Titan Steve McNair was found murdered alongside girlfriend Sahel Kazemi, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091219/SPORTS01/912190349/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Police have closed the investigation for good, still ruling it a murder-suicide</a>. The <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/felon-stunned-sentence-mcnair-gun-case\" target=\"_blank\">man who sold Kazemi the gun was sentenced to 30 months in prison</a>, but hopes to appeal the decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Borrowed time.</strong> We&#x2019;ve mentioned before that the Tennessee unemployment fund seems to be running out of cash, and now it looks almost certain that <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11705298\" target=\"_blank\">the state will have to borrow about $20 million from the federal government to keep it afloat</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The folks at the <em>Tennessean</em> received a surprise in the mail in the form of a <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091220/NEWS01/912200373/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">return-to-sender love letter from one of their former reporters</a> that was only about 56 years too late &#x2026; Starting next year, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091220/BUSINESS01/912200385/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">you&#x2019;ll be able to pick up your beer at Walgreens</a>. There won&#x2019;t be any&#xA0;forties, but that&#x2019;s what gas stations are for, right? &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11708339\" target=\"_blank\">How &#x2019;bout them Titans?</a> &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091220/NEWS0202/912200357/Nashville++Sounds+owners+revive+stadium+talks+\" target=\"_blank\">possibility of a new Sounds stadium</a> is back on the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/greystgirl/4190616515/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Grey Street Girl</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/01/20/bright-early-snow-etc-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Snow, Etc.
