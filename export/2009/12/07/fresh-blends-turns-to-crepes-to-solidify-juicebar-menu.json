Fresh Blends&#x2019; now-shuttered East Nashville store shelved some tasty t0-go wraps and salads, but this is the Belmont location&#x2019;s first solid food offering. We weren&#x2019;t quite sure how cr&#xEA;pes and smoothies would go together, but they&#x2019;re priced to entice, and enticed we were. The verdict? It works. The Classic (peanut butter or nutella spread with banana and whipped cream) and Fruit (choice of fresh strawberry, blueberry or raspberry topped with matching compote, sweet cream cheese spread and whipped cream) cr&#xEA;pes are decadent enough to treat any sweet tooth, but the Veggie (spinach, mushroom, squash and mozzerella with creamy balsamic vinaigrette)&#xA0;cr&#xEA;pe makes a great light lunch for (moderately) health-conscious folks on the go.</p>\n<p>While Fresh Blends&#x2019; drinks have traditionally been a bit pricy for our wallets, the new pairings are priced so low that we almost felt guilty ordering. Get a small smoothie &amp; cr&#xEA;pe combo for $5.99 (just to compare, a small smoothie stands alone at $4.19) or add a cr&#xEA;pe to any size juice or smoothie for $2. &#xC0;<em> la carte, </em>Classic &amp; Fruit cr&#xEA;pes are $2.99 and the Veggie rings in just slightly higher at $3.25. And this week, students with ID get an <a href=\"http://twitter.com/FreshBlends/status/6417228661\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/twitter.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">extra $1 knocked off the price</a>. As Belmont alumni, we&#x2019;re sort of ticked that we didn&#x2019;t have Fresh Blends around the corner when we were trudging up the boulevard to Country Line Dancing class (but hey, it looks like we survived).</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/qlinart/2818442868/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>qlinart</em></a><em> (note: photo not of Fresh Blends&#x2019; cr&#xEA;pes).</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/13/more-smoothies-please-fresh-blends-to-open-belmont-location/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Smoothies, Please: Fresh Blends To Open Belmont Location\">More Smoothies, Please: Fresh Blends To Open Belmont Location</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/09/fresh-blends-opens-belmont-location-tries-to-take-over-the-world-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends Opens Belmont Location, Tries To Take Over The World [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Fresh Blends Opens Belmont Location, Tries To Take Over The World [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/18/fresh-blends-exits-east-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends Exits East [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Fresh Blends Exits East [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/30/nashville-newcomers-fresh-blends-juice-smoothie-bar/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar\">Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/19/east-nashville-invasion-fresh-blends-ugly-mugs/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: East Nashville Invasion: Fresh Blends &amp; Ugly Mugs\">East Nashville Invasion: Fresh Blends &amp; Ugly Mugs</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
