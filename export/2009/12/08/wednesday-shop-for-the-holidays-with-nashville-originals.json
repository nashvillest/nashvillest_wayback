For those not familiar with Nashville Originals (you really don&#x2019;t read Nashvillest very often, do you?), here&#x2019;s the drill:</p>\n<p>Four times a year, <a href=\"http://nashvilleoriginals.com\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvilleoriginals.com&apos;]);\" target=\"blank\">Nashville Originals</a> hosts a discount gift certificate sale for a host of Nashville&#x2019;s, um, original restaurants. The best of the best. The cream of the crop. (You get the point.) These restaurants include The Acorn, Allium, Bound&#x2019;ry, Cabana, Caffe Nonna, ChaChah, Cross Corner, F. Scott&#x2019;s, Fido, Flyte, Germantown Cafe, Jackson&#x2019;s, Jimmy Kelly&#x2019;s, Mafiaoza&#x2019;s, Mambu, McCabe Pub, Midtown Cafe, Mirror, Noshville, The Pineapple Room, PM, Provence, Rumba, South Street, The Standard, Sunset Grill, Suzy Wong&#x2019;s House of Yum, Tayst, Tin Angel, Turnip Truck, Yellow Porch and Zola. You can snag a $20 gift certificate for $12, a $25 gift certificate for $16, and a $50 gift certificate for just $35. And those prices, coupled with the list of restaurants above, should speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this news comes hot on the heels of yesterday&#x2019;s news that beloved Nashville Originals restaurant <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091207/BUSINESS01/91207056\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Zola will close</a>, and last month&#x2019;s news that <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/bites/2009/11/mirror_plans_to_hang_it_up_by.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;blogs.nashvillescene.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Mirror will be shutting its doors</a>. Take one last chance to nab a discount visit, because both restaurants will be gone next year.</p>\n<p>Again, the chaos goes down <a href=\"http://www.instagift.com/nashvilleoriginals\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.instagift.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>, and the party usually starts around 6:45AM, though a time is never specified. These things go fast, so set your alarms early, and may the best net connection win.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/09/21/wednesday-fall-2009-nashville-originals-discount-gift-certificate-sale/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Wednesday: Fall 2009 Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificate Sale\">Wednesday: Fall 2009 Nashville Originals Discount Gift Certificate Sale</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/10/march-24-is-next-nashville-originals-discount-sale/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: March 24 Is Next Nashville Originals Discount Sale\">March 24 Is Next Nashville Originals Discount Sale</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/15/nashville-originals-new-members-discount-gift-certificates-tomorrow/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Originals: New Members, Gift Certificate Sale Tomorrow\">Nashville Originals: New Members, Gift Certificate Sale Tomorrow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/05/nashville-originals-great-food-on-the-cheap/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Originals: Great Food On The Cheap\">Nashville Originals: Great Food On The Cheap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/02/10/nashville-originals-are-back-again/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Originals Are Back Again!\">Nashville Originals Are Back Again!</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
