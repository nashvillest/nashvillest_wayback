In the past we&#x2019;ve often joked about the questionable state of the Cumberland River. <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/20/bright-early-we-blame-stagflation-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">Members of the Metro Council even swam across it once</a> just to get us all to stop talking about how gross it is. Now residents of a neighborhood near Madison are <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/21966938/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">complaining that some raw sewage from an unfinished property on Miami Avenue has been leaking into the river for months.</a> They&#x2019;ve been upset about this for quite some time and Metro Water is supposedly trying to look into fixing it, finally. Sounds like a nice day for another swim, huh?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A group called Nashville&#x2019;s Priorities is <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091215/NEWS0202/912150343/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">trying to gather enough signatures to land the Music City Center on a ballot for Davidson County voters to decide</a>. Though the group has a long way to go to rounding up 25,000 folks to sign, officials aren&#x2019;t extremely thrilled at the prospect because they feel it&#x2019;s the job of elected officials to decide things like this.</li>\n<li>After yesterday&#x2019;s story in the <em>Tennessean</em> about how children of undocumented immigrants being ineligible for most Angel Tree programs, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091215/NEWS01/912150340/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">several readers banded together to provide toys and Christmas presents for the 4-year old girl featured in the story</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> We hope you enjoyed the balmy 60-degree weather yesterday because<a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2009/12/not-as-warm-as-yesterday-not-even-close/\" target=\"_blank\"> we&#x2019;ll be back down into the 30s by this afternoon</a> &#x2026; The Preds won and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091214/SPORTS02/91214099/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Sully racked up another hat trick</a> &#x2026; Hickory Hollow residents are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11671361\" target=\"_blank\">none to pleased about the proposed WIC clinic</a> that might go into Hickory Hollow Mall.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/27263639_8a1d462a67.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><em>pfly</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/12/16/bright-early-a-drop-in-the-bucket-edition-2/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: A Drop In The Bucket Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: A Drop In The Bucket Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/16/bright-early-smug-as-a-bug-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Smug As A Bug Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Smug As A Bug Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
