A few weeks ago, Mayor Dean decided to keep everything up and running through the end of 2010 without the fair and racetrack, but Councilman Eric Crafton hopes to save the whole shebang.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The inventor of the Wikipedia (so basically, the internet) will be <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/28d4cb52-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">gracing Nashville with his presence soon</a> &#x2026; Preds owner David Freeman <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091201/NEWS0202/912010346/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">is pretty much flat broke</a> &#x2026; The <em>Tennessean </em>explains <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091201/SPORTS01/912010351/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">exactly how the Titans are going to get to the playoffs</a>.
