A <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2009/12/white-christmas-update-2/\" target=\"_blank\">white Christmas is looking a little less likely</a> as we get closer to the holiday. We&#x2019;ve been reading all sorts of fancy explanations of the impending storm system over the past several days, but now it looks like the weather just isn&#x2019;t going to be cold enough for more than a few flurries. As it stands now, we&#x2019;ll probably be seeing a cold, stormy, wet Christmas instead. Once again, there&#x2019;s always next year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Highs and lows. </strong><a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/young-returns-titans-practice?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-Sports+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Sports%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Vince Young made it back to practice yesterday</a> after sitting out for a few days this week due to a hamstring injury he suffered on Sunday. And we suppose this is where we talk about <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11697463\" target=\"_blank\">the truck that exploded into flames in front of his house last night too</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>What&#x2019;s in a name?</strong> It seems that <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/12/17/book-it/\" target=\"_blank\">the Preds and the Sommet Group might be close to reaching an agreement over naming rights for the Nashville-Sommet-Arena-Center</a>. Though nothing&#x2019;s official yet, we&#x2019;re happy they&#x2019;re working things out.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> &#x2026; The <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=13409\" target=\"_blank\">latest estimate for the Kingston cleanup</a> is five years &#x2026; Councilman Eric Crafton may be gearing up for <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/crafton-considering-run-juvenile-court-clerk\" target=\"_blank\">a run for Juvenile Court Clerk</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/38d60016-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">West Tennessee felt another quake early this morning</a> originating in Missouri.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gypsy-girl/4186100429/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">gypsygirl.photography</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/04/bright-early-waking-up-in-the-tundra-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Waking Up In The Tundra Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Waking Up In The Tundra Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/25/happy-hour-501broadway-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: #501broadway Edition\">Happy Hour: #501broadway Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/03/bright-early-whats-in-a-name-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: What&#x2019;s In A Name Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: What&#x2019;s In A Name Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/11/22/bright-early-field-of-broken-dreams-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Field Of Broken Dreams Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Field Of Broken Dreams Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/07/bright-early-fight-or-flight-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Fight Or Flight Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Fight Or Flight Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
