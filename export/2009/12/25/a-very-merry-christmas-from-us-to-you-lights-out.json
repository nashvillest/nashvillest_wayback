Like many of you, we&#x2019;ve spent the past few days on the road dodging snow drifts and ice storms and running around the country visiting all the folks we like and love. So while we gorge ourselves on holiday cookies and home-cooked meals, we&#x2019;re shutting things down around here for a few days. We promise we&#x2019;ll be back in time to guide you through your Nashville New Years Eve adventures, though. In the meantime, happy holidays and safe travels!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallingwater123/4211693074/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">fallingwater123</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/12/18/win-a-free-nashville-citipass-book-merry-christmas/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Win A Free Nashville Citipass Book!
