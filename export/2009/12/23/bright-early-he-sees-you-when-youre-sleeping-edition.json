Yesterday brought us an <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091222/NEWS01/91222060/Bad+Santa+robs+Nashville+area+bank\" target=\"_blank\">entertaining-but-sort-of-scary tale of Santa robbing a local bank at gunpoint</a> (and the pictures&#x2026; <a href=\"http://i49.tinypic.com/2rcpztd.png\" target=\"_blank\">oh, the pictures!</a>) We&#x2019;re happy to be able to balance it out this morning with another Christmas-y story, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11719169\" target=\"_blank\">only this one involves a mysterious woman handing out Christmas cards containing $100 to random strangers in the Dickson Kmart</a>. Several shoppers were approached by the woman who handed them an envelope, wished them a Merry Christmas, and then disappeared into the store. Hooray for random acts of kindness!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Merry Christmas! </strong>Another random act of kindness happened at a Franklin Waffle House when <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11720849\" target=\"_blank\">a group of men left a $400 tip as they slipped out the door</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Playing with food.</strong> Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11718968\" target=\"_blank\">Murfreesboro is dealing with pressing emergencies such as The Case Of The Exploding Ketchup which apparently warranted a 911 call</a>. It seems that some hooligans are somehow rigging restaurant ketchup bottles to turn into a &#x201C;volcano&#x201D; of ketchup upon opening and this is considered tampering with food, which is a felony.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> It wouldn&#x2019;t be Christmas without someone <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11721867\" target=\"_blank\">threatening to blow up our airport</a> &#x2026; If you&#x2019;re staying in town for Christmas, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11721867\" target=\"_blank\">expect a lot of rain and wind</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11721544\" target=\"_blank\">More Swine Flu vaccines are being recalled</a> for not being potent enough &#x2026; Tanning beds are now <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11720197\" target=\"_blank\">subject to a special tax</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wjb13/4084600629/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">wjb13</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
