Yes, the hundreds of Santas you see carousing downtown are for real. The annual Nashville Santa Rampage is this Saturday, December 12, and from the looks of the 300+ &#x201C;Attending&#x201D; RSVP&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/event.php?eid=351599865295&amp;index=1\" target=\"_blank\">on Facebook</a>, it&#x2019;s going to be a jolly good time.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of Santas barhopping and spreading Christmas cheer &#x2013; er, &#x201C;jeer&#x201D; &#x2013; downtown is one of our favorite sights to behold each year. Anyone is welcome to join in the fun, but there are a few rules. Like&#x2026; Don&#x2019;t show up without a Santa suit. Don&#x2019;t make children cry. Pay for your beer. Don&#x2019;t get arrested. Etc. It&#x2019;s simple!</p>\n<p>Santas will begin rampaging on Saturday at 6pm in East Nashville at 3 Crow Bar, then move to Beer Sellar at 8pm for the traditional downtown loop.
