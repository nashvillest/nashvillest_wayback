Our daily commutes are such an adventure that we&#x2019;re really not surprised that Tennessee drivers scored 38th place in a test administered by GMAC Insurance to test basic driving knowledge.

We hate to say it, but <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/18/welcome-to-nashville-weve-got-bad-drivers/\" target=\"_blank\">we told you so</a>. <em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dbcotton/status/1877870315\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Cotton</a> for the tip!</em></p><p>And we may have figured out why Tennessee has such bad drivers.
