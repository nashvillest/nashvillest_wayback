When the quirky tex-mex chain <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/05/chuys-bringing-elvis-tex-mex-to-cool-springs-comings-goings/\" target=\"_blank\">announced they&#x2019;d be opening their first location outside of Texas in Middle Tennessee</a> in 2009, we were blown away by the passionate Chuy&#x2019;s fans flocking to Cool Springs en masse to get their fill of kitschy Elvis-themed decor, giant burritos and creamy jalape&#xF1;o.

Scratch that). In the meantime, they&#x2019;ll be working hard to brighten up&#xA0;<a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-17-at-10.20.23-AM.png\" target=\"_blank\">this crazy old building</a> into one of their cheery eateries plastered with primary colors. We&#x2019;ll be lining up for happy hour with the best of &#x2018;em, and can we throw in a vote for some patio seating?</p>\n<p><em>Photo from </em><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ChuysNashville\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Chuy&#x2019;s &#x2013; Nashville</em></a><em> on Facebook. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/10/10/chuys-midtown-location-opens-tomorrow-burrito-time-is-our-favorite-time/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Chuy&#x2019;s Midtown Location Opens Tomorrow!
