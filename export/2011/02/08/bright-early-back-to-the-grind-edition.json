If the budget hearings of the past few weeks have been any indication, it&#x2019;s going to be a long year fraught with budget cuts across pretty much every state department. The new lawmakers also expect to deal with some controversial education, immigration and voter&#x2019;s rights issues this year. And speaking of controversy, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/state-legislation-filed-block-proposed-metro-nondiscrimination-bill?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Rep. Glen Casada filed a bill yesterday to block localities from passing nondiscrimination employment policies that cover anything other than what&#x2019;s in the Civil Rights Act</a>, meaning that these policies couldn&#x2019;t prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Energy assistance demand on the rise. </strong>Since our energy bills have been so dang high in the past few months, more and more people are applying for assistance, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13984889\" target=\"_blank\">which has been a little overwhelming for the agencies that can help them</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Something in the water. </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/health/26782416/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">issue of&#xA0;fluoride&#xA0;in tap water has at least one group of lawmakers riled up this year</a>. Though fluoride is put into the water to help prevent tooth decay, many opponents argue that it poses a number of health risks and hope to eliminate it.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong><a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/02/cold-and-breezy-today-another-accumulating-snow-starts-wednesday-afternoon/\" target=\"_blank\">More snow on Wednesday</a>! &#x2026; If you&#x2019;re looking for volunteer opportunities, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13988961\" target=\"_blank\">Second Harvest and Red Cross could both really use some help right now</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/26787060/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Some new plans for a scaled-back May Town Center</a> will likely be introduced soon &#x2026; Sen.
