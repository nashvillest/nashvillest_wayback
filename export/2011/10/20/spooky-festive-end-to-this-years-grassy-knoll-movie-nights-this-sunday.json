Outdoor movies are the best! Now, with a solid season of cult classics behind them &#x2013; <em>Lucas</em>, <em>Harold &amp; Maude</em>, <em>Rear Window</em>, <em>The Princess Bride</em>, <em>Cool Hand Luke</em> and&#xA0;<em>Annie Hall</em> &#x2013; they&#x2019;re wrapping up the year in October with&#xA0;<em>Poltergeist</em>. Appropriate for the season, is it not?</p>\n<p>Arrive early for a Neighborhood Fall Festival before the movie. Belly-warming beverages from Hot &amp; Cold, Bang Candy Company and Jackalope Brewery will be present, plus pumpkin decorating (BYOP), face painting by Chrome Halo, bobbing for apples, live music, a costume contest and &#x201C;possible zombification&#x201D; are all on the agenda. We think the new owner of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/nashvillest/status/126412363690807296\" target=\"_blank\">that Ke$ha Halloween costume on Craigslist</a> would be wise to debut his or her new digs and clean up &#x2013; or glitter up &#x2013; that costume contest prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Grassy Knoll Movie Night &amp; Neighborhood Fall Festival on Sunday, October 23 in the side lot beside Bongo Java East. Fall Fest from 4-6pm, <em>Poltergeist </em>begins at sundown. $5 admission for the movie and festival (or $4 with a canned food donation), $1 for kids. $5 suggested donation for festival only.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Emily Spence for&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/grassyknollmovies\" target=\"_blank\">Grassy Knoll Movie Nights</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/07/06/grassy-knoll-movie-nights-in-east-nashville-start-this-sunday/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Grassy Knoll Movie Nights In East Nashville Start This Sunday\">Grassy Knoll Movie Nights In East Nashville Start This Sunday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/10/22/the-weekendist-october-22-24-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: October 22-24 Edition\">The Weekendist: October 22-24 Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/07/22/the-weekendist-dog-days-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Dog Days Edition\">The Weekendist: Dog Days Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/10/17/the-swell-season-movie-sigur-ros-inni-screening-at-the-belcourt-this-fall/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Swell Season Movie, Sigur R&#xF3;s&#x2019; &#x201C;Inni&#x201D; Screening At The Belcourt This Fall\">The Swell Season Movie, Sigur R&#xF3;s&#x2019; &#x201C;Inni&#x201D; Screening At The Belcourt This Fall</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/09/the-weekendist-are-those-leaves-on-the-ground-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Are Those Leaves On The Ground Edition\">The Weekendist: Are Those Leaves On The Ground Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
