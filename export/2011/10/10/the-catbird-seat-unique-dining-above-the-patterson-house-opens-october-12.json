We have, and we&#x2019;re about to find out. <a href=\"https://thecatbirdseatrestaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Catbird Seat</a>, located above The Patterson House at 1711 Division Street, opens on Wednesday, October 12. The Catbird Seat will accommodate just 30 diners a night at a large, U-shaped table with their critically-acclaimed chefs at the center, serving each diner a seven-course meal from seasonal, local (like&#x2026; <a href=\"http://thecatbirdseatrestaurant.tumblr.com/post/11067339036/foraging\" target=\"_blank\">from the backyard local</a>) ingredients. The unique dining experience will set you back $100 per person plus tax and a tip (and an extra $30 a person for drink pairings). <a href=\"https://thecatbirdseatrestaurant.com/reservation\" target=\"_blank\">Reservations</a> have been open for a few weeks now, but to our surprise there were still a few spots open in October when we checked.</p>\n<p>Checking out The Catbird Seat in the next few weeks? We&#x2019;d love to hear from you in the comments, because let&#x2019;s face it &#x2013; our pockets aren&#x2019;t exactly padded with that kind of cash. Still, we&#x2019;re intrigued.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thecatbirdseatrestaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Catbird Seat</a> opens Wednesday, October 12 at 1711 Division Street. <a href=\"https://thecatbirdseatrestaurant.com/reservation\" target=\"_blank\">Reservations</a> required. </strong></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://thecatbirdseatrestaurant.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Catbird Seat</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
