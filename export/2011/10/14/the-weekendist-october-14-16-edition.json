Panels, readings and discussions from dozens of authors. <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/10/14/free-things-that-wed-pay-for-anyway-southern-festival-of-books/\" target=\"_blank\">For free</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.tnagmuseum.org/special.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;http://www.tnagmuseum.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Music &amp; Molasses Arts &amp; Crafts Festival</a></strong>. <em>Saturday-Sunday, October 15-16 at the Tennessee Agricultural Museum, 9-4pm Saturday, 10-4pm Sunday, $5. </em>Here is a list of delightful things about the Music &amp; Molasses Arts &amp; Crafts Festival: Molasses making demonstrations, clogging, homemade pie, taffy pulls. And more!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.barcampnashville.org/bcn11/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;http://www.barcampnashville.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">BarCamp Nashville</a>. </strong><em>Saturday, October 15 at Cadillac Ranch. 9-5pm, free</em>. Want to learn more about social media, coding, project management and all other things tech? Want to do it for free? <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/10/10/barcamp-nashville-unites-techies-for-p2p-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">Yeah, we do too</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.musiccitychilicookoff.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;http://www.musiccitychilicookoff.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Chili Cookoff</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, October 15 at the Event Pavilion in Centennial Park, 11am-4pm, $5 admission, $15 beer garden</em>. Fall means one thing to many people. Chili weather! $5 admission gets you chili tastings, live music, bouncy inflatable things for the kiddos and more. Another $15 will get you six 8oz glasses of beer from Yazoo and two shots of apple pie moonshine, which is quite frankly a lot of booze for $15.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.irunfortheparty.com/index.php?page=events_view&amp;event_id=21\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;http://www.irunfortheparty.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Halloween in the Gulch 10k/5k &amp; Block Party</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, October 15 in the Gulch, 5-9pm, $40 to run/free to party</em>. We&#x2019;re big fans of the Halloween in the Gulch 5/10k because it&#x2019;s at night, thus sparing us from waking up early to run. Who are we kidding? We&#x2019;re not running this thing. The post-party is a huge block party, and it&#x2019;s a blast. Runners and spectators in costume, creepy cocktails and more.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/10/13/check-out-new-exhibits-at-the-frist-centers-free-egypt-family-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Egypt Family Day at the Frist</a></strong>. <em>Sunday, October 16 at the Frist Center, 1-5:30pm, free. </em>The Frist&#x2019;s newest exhibit is all about Egyptian Treasures, and in keeping with the theme they&#x2019;re offering a free Egypt Family Day this Sunday. Arts &amp; crafts for the kids (or for the adults &#x2013; we won&#x2019;t judge you) and free admission for all, free days at the Frist are some of our favorite days.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNkaZ2DgTc\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;http://www.youtube.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Yazoo&#x2019;s First Annual Big Wheel Championships</a></strong>. <em>Sunday, October 16 downtown at Church St between 1st &amp; 2nd Aves, 12pm, $40 to race/free to watch</em>. Participant tickets are sold out for this one, but that&#x2019;s okay. We&#x2019;d rather watch the hilarity (and spend our $40 on beer). Head downtown to watch grown adults peddle Big Wheels around downtown &#x2013; the fun starts at noon, and races start at 2pm sharp!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mfitzphoto/5008381981/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;http://www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">MFitzPhoto</a>. </em></p>"
