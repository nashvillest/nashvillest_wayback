Luckily, TPAC knows exactly how to cater to the cheapskates in our souls, and they&#x2019;re doing just that by offering a limited $25 ticket lottery a few hours before the show each night. Interested? Show up two and a half hours before showtime to throw your name in the hat, then stick around for a half hour and see if you scored the goods. If your name is drawn, you can purchase two sweet orchestra seats for just $25 each.</p>\n<p><strong>WICKED opens at TPAC&#x2019;s Andrew Jackson Hall on October 19, running through November 6. Regular tickets run $40-160 and can be purchased <a href=\"http://patron.tpac.org/main.taf?NSC=1330&amp;p=9,5,1&amp;ProductionID=1881&amp;showOverview=1\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;patron.tpac.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/holster/438992779/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Holster</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/03/this-weekend-sweeney-todd-opens-at-tpac/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: This Weekend: Sweeney Todd Opens At TPAC\">This Weekend: Sweeney Todd Opens At TPAC</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
