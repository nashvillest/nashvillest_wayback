The parties run from May through October every time there&#x2019;s a full moon, meaning that this Friday&#x2019;s event is your last chance of the season to catch this bit of Nashville magic. What exactly <em>is </em>a pickin&#x2019; party, you may ask? It&#x2019;s just a bunch of folks getting together on a moonlit night and jamming out to some bluegrass over food (for purchase!) and drinks (included!) Tickets are a little steep at $15 in advance or $20 at the door, but they include a couple of drink tickets and all proceeds fund flood cleanup for the parks and all sorts of awesome educational programs. In addition to a great bluegrass lineup on the main stage, folks are invited to bring a couple of camping chairs and bluegrass instruments of their own for some impromptu jam sessions throughout the evening. Carting in your own approved instrument will get you a heftily discounted admission of just five bucks.</p>\n<p><strong>The last <a href=\"http://www.friendsofwarnerparks.com/pickingparty.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Moon Pickin&#x2019; Party</a> of the season, benefiting Friends of Warner Parks, happens this Friday, October 14th from 7 to 11 PM at the <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2500+Old+Hickory+Blvd.+Nashville+TN&amp;sll=36.05609,-86.89868&amp;sspn=0.008119,0.015557&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=36.055188,-86.894088&amp;spn=0.008119,0.015557&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;g=2500+Old+Hickory+Blvd.+Nashville+TN&amp;iwloc=addr\" target=\"_blank\">Equestrian Barn on Old Hickory Blvd</a>.
