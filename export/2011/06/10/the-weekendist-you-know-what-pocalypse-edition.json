Wondering what you&#x2019;re going to do while all your friends are at Bonnaroo and you&#x2019;re trapped in your house by the CMApocalypse? No worries, we&#x2019;ve got you covered this weekend. This may sound crazy, but we fully endorse heading downtown to mingle with the masses. There are&#xA0;<a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/06/06/let-the-games-begin-cmapocalypse-bingo-2011/\" target=\"_blank\">bingo boards</a> to be filled out, giggles to be had, and free shows to attend! Here are our top picks for the weekend:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/21/sounds-like-summer-nashville-symphony-to-host-free-community-concerts-once-again/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Symphony Community Concert</a></strong>. <em>Friday, June 10 at 8pm, Bicentennial Mall, free</em>. The Nashville Symphony&#x2019;s free community concerts are in high gear this week after last night&#x2019;s performance at East Park. Tonight, they&#x2019;ll be performing &#x201C;A Salute to Boston Pops&#x201D; at Bicentennial Mall, and if you want to haul out to Brentwood on Sunday you can catch the same show there.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.cumberlandrivercompact.org/events_catfishrodeo.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.cumberlandrivercompact.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Catfish Rodeo and Water Festival</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, June 11 from 8am-11pm, Shelby Park&#x2019;s Lake Sevier, kids ages 5-16, free</em>. Take the kids fishing in Shelby Park, where Lake Sevier will be stocked with 1,700 pounds of catfish. No fishing licenses are necessary, and the fishing wraps before the sun comes out full force. Only the first 600 kids get to fish, but there will be booths and activities for the non-fishers.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.musicianscornernashville.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.musicianscornernashville.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Musician&#x2019;s Corner</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, June 11 from 3-6pm at Centennial Park (main lawn), free</em>.

Featuring special guest Emmylou Harris, the lineup also includes&#xA0;Love and Theft, The Henningsens, Sara Jean Kelly, Heather Morgan and Andrew Combs. We&#x2019;re not sure how it&#x2019;s related, but Gildan Activewear will also be attempting to break the record for the world&#x2019;s largest t-shirt at this week&#x2019;s event, so there&#x2019;s that. You can always count on lots of food trucks, great local music and a few surprises at Musician&#x2019;s Corner.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://secure.sitemason.com/www.marthaobryan.org/crankin/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;secure.sitemason.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Miss Martha&#x2019;s Ice Cream Crankin</a></strong>&#x2018;.&#xA0;<em>Sunday, June 12 from 3-5pm,&#xA0;First Presbyterian Church (Franklin Rd), $13 adults, $10 kids</em>.
