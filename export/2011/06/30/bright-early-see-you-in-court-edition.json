Eight vendors have already been cited and fined for violating the ordinance, which the city says is a matter of safety. Though Brentwood has already amended this ordinance to allow vendors on sidewalks only, effective July 1, <em>The Contributor </em>is still concerned about the First Amendment violation and adverse effects on vendors&#x2019; livelihoods. The Contributor currently has about twice the distribution of any other homeless newspaper in the U.S. or Canada.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Repeat offender. </strong><a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14999459/titans-wr-kenny-britt-surrenders-to-metro-police\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Titans badboy Kenny Britt continued his offseason adventures this week by turning himself into Metro Police for a couple of outstanding warrants regarding some false information he provided on a driver&#x2019;s license application</a>. Though he was booked into the Metro jail, he posted bail shortly thereafter. This brings the official count up to three arrests this year and seven encounters with the law since he came to the Titans in 2009.</li>\n<li><strong>Oh, blast. </strong>Belmont University is building a giant new dorm near the corner of 15th and Bernard, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14998395/belmont-breaks-ground-on-new-residence-hall\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">but neighbors aren&#x2019;t too fond of all the blasting that will be going on for the next few months</a>. At 8am, 11am, 1pm and 3pm every day, construction crews will be setting off explosives that rock the surrounding neighborhoods.
