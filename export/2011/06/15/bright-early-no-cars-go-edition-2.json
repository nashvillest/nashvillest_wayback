In news that will likely be shocking to no one, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/report-2015-85-percent-nashville-area-seniors-will-lack-adequate-access-mass-trans?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">a new report by Transportation for America has ranked Nashville as the fourth worst Metro area for public transportation</a>. The report specifically zeroed in on the fact that as baby boomers get older, 85% of &#xA0;Nashville&#x2019;s seniors won&#x2019;t have access to any sort of public transit by 2015. This would keep them from going to the doctor, eating out, buying stuff and visiting friends and family. Metro is already looking at ways to expand our transit system in the next few decades and increase access to health car and grocery stores.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lockout continues. </strong><a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=14904631\" target=\"_blank\">The NFL and Player&#x2019;s Association are meeting again to try and find enough common ground to end the lockout, though inside sources say &#xA0;an agreement in the near future is &#x201C;unlikely.&#x201D;</a> For those keeping track at home, the Titans&#x2019; first game is scheduled to take place on September 11th in Jacksonville.</li>\n<li><strong>Cupcakes go to college. </strong>The Cupcake Collection&#x2019;s beloved Cupcake Bus is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14906408/cupcake-collection-employees-take-bus-on-road\" target=\"_blank\">going on a little roadtrip along the East Coast with four high school grads at the helm who are hoping to raise money for college</a>.
