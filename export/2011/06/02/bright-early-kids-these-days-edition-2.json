Like many of you, we were a little concerned when we saw a flurry of tweets last night about some sort of violence going down at Centennial Park. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14825772/teen-shot-during-event-at-centennial-park\" target=\"_blank\">Though we&#x2019;re still not entirely sure what happened, we do know that a teenager was shot in the knee while police were trying to disperse a crowd during Movies In The Park</a>. Word seemed to spread on Twitter that something was about to happen before it actually did, and Metro Police responded by showing up en masse trying to break up the crowd. One person was arrested with a loaded gun, though they don&#x2019;t believe he was the one who fired shots and are still investigating the incident. Here&#x2019;s hoping the rest of the Movies In The Park series is a little less eventful.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Web entertainment law passed.</strong> As of July 1, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110602/NEWS/306020033/2275/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">it&#x2019;ll be illegal in Tennessee to use a someone else&#x2019;s credentials to login to online paid subscription services like Netflix or Rhapsody whether you have permission or not</a>. Our state is the first to pass a law like this and lawmakers hope they won&#x2019;t be the last.</li>\n<li><strong>D&#x2019;aww. </strong>When they weren&#x2019;t busy breaking up riots at Centennial, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14776115/officers-rescue-baby-falcon-in-downtown-nashville\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Police were rescuing a really cute baby falcon from the corner of 4th and Church</a>. They packed up the tiny bird and kept it in the precinct while they tracked down Walden&#x2019;s Puddle, which is a wildlife rehabilitation organization, to take care of it. When she&#x2019;s old enough to survive on her own, she&#x2019;ll be put through mouse school (we don&#x2019;t know what this means, but it sounds adorable) and released back into the wild.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> One of the founders of Galaxy Star, an alleged gang rehabilitation organization, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14788719/nonprofit-leader-pleads-guilty-to-helping-gangs\" target=\"_blank\">pleaded guilty to racketeering charges related to allegations that his organization actually provided meeting space for the Bloods and signed off on fake community service hours for members</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110601/NEWS01/110601015/2275/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">Wave Country wasted no time coming up with a new plan to beef up security measures</a> after their eventful weekend &#x2026; If you&#x2019;ve got a few cases of bottled water lying around, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14815657/nashville-rescue-mission-needs-more-water-for-heat-patrol\" target=\"_blank\">the Nashville Rescue Mission could really use them</a> &#x2026; Metro would like to remind everyone once again that <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14823978/police-remind-teens-parents-of-reinstated-juvenile-curfew\" target=\"_blank\">they&#x2019;ve reinstated their curfew law for minors</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/litetra/4973025840/\" target=\"_blank\">Bobby Bradley</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/26/bright-early-kids-these-days-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Kids These Days Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Kids These Days Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/05/10/movies-in-the-park-2011-lineup-includes-500-days-of-summer-harry-potter-ferris-buellers-day-off-more/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Movies In The Park 2011: 500 Days Of Summer, Harry Potter, Ferris Bueller&#x2019;s Day Off &amp; More\">Movies In The Park 2011: 500 Days Of Summer, Harry Potter, Ferris Bueller&#x2019;s Day Off &amp; More</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/05/21/movies-in-the-park-2010-kicks-off-june-2-with-where-the-wild-things-are/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;\">Movies In The Park 2010 Kicks Off June 2 With &#x201C;Where The Wild Things Are&#x201D;</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/09/bright-early-the-kids-arent-alright-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: The Kids Aren&#x2019;t Alright Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: The Kids Aren&#x2019;t Alright Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/02/schools-out-free-summer-movies-for-kids/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids\">School&#x2019;s Out: Free Summer Movies For Kids</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
