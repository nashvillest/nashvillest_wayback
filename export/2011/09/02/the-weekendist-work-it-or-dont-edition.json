A portion of all profits benefit The GEAR Foundation, and you can expect 8 fantastic jazz acts to take the stage through the fest, including headliners&#xA0;C.J. Chenier and The Red Hot Louisiana Band and&#xA0;The Nashville Jazz Orchestra featuring Blue Lou Marini (Blues Brothers) and Charles &#x201C;Wig&#x201D; Walker (The Dynamites).</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/faraz/1313400185/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">_Faraz</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/06/17/the-weekendist-party-in-the-usa-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Party In The USA Edition\">The Weekendist: Party In The USA Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/05/27/the-weekendist-memorial-day-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Memorializing Edition\">The Weekendist: Memorializing Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/09/the-weekendist-are-those-leaves-on-the-ground-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Are Those Leaves On The Ground Edition\">The Weekendist: Are Those Leaves On The Ground Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/09/02/73rd-national-folk-festival-comes-to-nashville-this-weekend/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: 73rd National Folk Festival Comes To Nashville This Weekend\">73rd National Folk Festival Comes To Nashville This Weekend</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/06/10/the-weekendist-you-know-what-pocalypse-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: You-Know-What-Pocalypse Edition\">The Weekendist: You-Know-What-Pocalypse Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
