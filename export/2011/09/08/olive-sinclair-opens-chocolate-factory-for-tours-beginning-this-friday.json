We&#x2019;re kind of obsessed. We&#x2019;ve sampled all the O&amp;S chocolate varieties (and then some). We&#x2019;ve gifted countless bars to out of town friends, spreading the O&amp;S gospel far and wide. We&#x2019;ve raced to Yazoo for the <a href=\"http://yazoobrew.blogspot.com/2010/02/stout-infused-with-olive-and-sinclair.html\" target=\"_blank\">tapping of a keg infused with O&amp;S cocao shells</a>. But until this week, curious superfans like us had to be content with peering through the windows of their Riverside Village operation, because tours were a scarce commodity on an invite-only basis. Not anymore! &#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2011/09/07/olive-sinclair-opens-chocolate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Olive &amp; Sinclair announced yesterday that they will begin offering tours to the public on Fridays beginning September 30</a>, and we couldn&#x2019;t be happier. Here&#x2019;s the scoop:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The tour introduces guests to the artisanal techniques executed by the Music City natives. Visitors will gain insight into the craftsmanship of traditional and modern chocolate methods, as well as savor the company&#x2019;s award-winning delectable treats and new flavor creations.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Samples, eh? Sign us up (again and again and again).</p>\n<p>Tours are $5 for adults, $1 for kids, cash only every Friday at 4pm and 5:30pm. You can find Olive &amp; Sinclair tucked away in Riverside Village at&#xA0;1404 McGavock Pike, Suite C (behind Mitchell Deli and Castrillo&#x2019;s Pizza).</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tmlens/4528725009/\" target=\"_blank\">tmlens</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/06/you-tell-us-home-of-the-best-hot-chocolate-nashvillest-polls/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: You Tell Us: Home Of The Best Hot Chocolate?
