And snow can only mean one thing, other than the bread & milk shelves emptying out: It’s time for a citywide snowball fight!

And snow can only mean one thing, other than the bread &amp; milk shelves emptying out: It&#x2019;s time for a citywide snowball fight! (Okay, so snow can mean a lot of things, especially in Nashville, but we&#x2019;re prioritizing.)</p>\n<p>We attended an impromptu snowball fight last year in Centennial Park, and magical things happened. A mythical beer truck may or may not have provided belly-warming nourishment. We ambushed news crews with snowballs. We slid on cookie sheets pulled by bicycles. We pub-crawled afterward. We made a bunch of new friends. At a citywide snowball fight, all your wildest dreams can come true.</p>\n<p>So! Join us tonight at 6pm-ish in Centennial Park for the first citywide snowball fight of 2011, if you can get out of your driveways. If you&#x2019;re for real snowed in, start throwing snowballs at your neighbors and see if you can&#x2019;t get some fun started of your very own!</p>\n<p><strong>Citywide Snowball Fight. Monday, January 10, 2011. Centennial Park (West End side of the Parthenon)</strong>. <em>Bring sleds, cookie sheets, and bundle up!</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nathanbaker/4314284989/\" target=\"_blank\">nathantbaker</a>.</em></p>"
