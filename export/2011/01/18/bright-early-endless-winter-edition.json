Our weather alerts have already started flashing orange and red in anticipation of the wintry weather we might get at the end of this week. <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/01/all-rain-tuesday-few-flurries-wed-am-accumulating-snow-thursday-night-but-not-as-much-as-last-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Though this storm system looks like it will bring us less snow than last time</a>, we&#x2019;re could be looking at some travel problems on Thursday night and Friday morning. Which probably means the kids will be out of school again! They&#x2019;re never going to learn anything, at this rate. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110118/NEWS01/110118008/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">We did learn a very interesting new term this morning: <em>Arctic oscillation</em></a>. We don&#x2019;t really understand what it means, but apparently it&#x2019;s the name for the thing we should blame for all this snowy weather.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fire crews called to Opryland. </strong>The Opryland Hotel <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/13859936/fire-crews-respond-overnight-to-opryland-hotel\" target=\"_blank\">nearly gave us a heart attack last night when fire crews responded to some smoke in the boiler room</a>. Turns out it was just an oil line that blew, there was no fire and no one was hurt. Gotta love that Opryland, always keeping us on our toes!</li>\n<li><strong>Going paperless. </strong>At some point soon, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/13859513/jobless-in-state-can-get-benefits-electronically\" target=\"_blank\">folks receiving unemployment benefits will be able to get the electronically by way of direct deposit or a debit card</a>. The new system should save our state about $3.2 million in postage costs annually.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> In addition to that widespread flu outbreak, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13857334\" target=\"_blank\">we&#x2019;ve also got a widespread stomach virus outbreak</a>. You&#x2019;ll find us holed up in our house wearing surgical masks for the next few weeks &#x2026; The Nashville Zoo <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/nashville-zoo-draws-640000-visitors-2010-sets-record?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">set an all-time attendance record of 640,000 total visitors</a> during 2010 &#x2026; <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/lisa-howe-hoping-approval-metro-anti-discrimination-bill?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Former Belmont coach Lisa Howe will be making an appearance at tonight&#x2019;s Metro Council meeting</a> while they debate a new non-discrimination ordinance &#x2026; Food prices are on track to reach their <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13858391\" target=\"_self\">highest point since the recession</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joey_m43/5360726354/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\">Joey Hinton</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/03/24/bright-early-redbud-winter-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: Redbud Winter Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: Redbud Winter Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
