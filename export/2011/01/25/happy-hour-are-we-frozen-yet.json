A winter storm warning has been issued from midnight tonight through noon tomorrow and y&#x2019;all already went and crashed our favorite local weather source Nashville WX, otherwise we&#x2019;d throw them a link. But trust us, that&#x2019;s what they said.</li>\n<li>Sumner County added four more snow days to their school schedule<em> just in case</em>. Metro, of course, has already used up all of theirs.

So enjoy your milk, egg and ground beef sandwiches everyone.

Though we&#x2019;ve never stayed there ourselves, we have to wonder if these people considered the Stadium Inn in their contest?

Ryan Haynes wants to pass a law allowing Tennesseans to yield when turning right on red rather than coming to a complete stop. Apparently lots of folks are being caught by red light cameras for rolling on through when the coast is clear.
