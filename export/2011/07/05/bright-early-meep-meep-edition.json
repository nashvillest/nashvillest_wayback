We hope you enjoyed your long weekend as much as we did, and if you&#x2019;re not one of the 45,500 people who gathered around the giant U2 space ship on Saturday, <a href=\"http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2011/07/03/u2-makes-triumphant-return-to-nashville-with-larger-than-life-show/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;blogs.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">you can read all about it over at the <em>Tennessean</em></a>.

In that case, we salute you! And if you were none of the above, well, we hope you found fun in some other places.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gallatin fireworks canceled. </strong>Unfortunately the folks out in Gallatin didn&#x2019;t get to enjoy a fireworks show this year, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/15025338/gallatin-fireworks-cancelled-last-minute\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">as the pyrotechnic company in charge of the show took the city&#x2019;s money and then promptly disappeared</a>, forcing city officials to cancel it last-minute.
