It&#x2019;s hot. The only things we really want to do this weekend are:</p>\n<p>a) Play in a sprinkler and/or kiddie pool in the backyard<br>\nb) Have a contest to see who can keep their head in the freezer the longest<br>\nc) Only eat frozen things, preferably ice cream<br>\nd) &#xA0;Build a tent over the air conditioner vent and have a campout</p>\n<p>But since we know that you&#x2019;re all probably way less wimpy than we are, we compiled a list of things to do this weekend anyway. Here are our top picks:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.avondalepark.net/redcaboose.htm\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.avondalepark.net&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Red Caboose Concert featuring the Western Swingers</a></strong>. <em>Friday, July 22 from 7-9pm at the Red Caboose Amphitheater in Bellevue, free</em>. Pack your dinner and head for the park, where you can settle in for an evening of swing tunes from the Western Swingers. Bring the kids, it&#x2019;s family friendly!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilleexpocenter.org/expo/fleamarket/index.asp\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvilleexpocenter.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Flea Market</a></strong>.&#xA0;<em>Friday (8am-5pm), Saturday (7am-6pm) and Sunday (7am-4pm), July 22-24, Tennessee State Fairgrounds, free (parking $5). </em>It&#x2019;s flea market weekend in Nashville. The fairgrounds will be packed to the gills with treasures all weekend, but get there early to snag the best finds. Don&#x2019;t forget cash!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://nashville.sounds.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t556\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashville.sounds.milb.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Sounds vs. Iowa Cubs</a></strong>. <em>Friday (7:05pm), Saturday &amp; Sunday (6:35pm), July 22-24 at Greer Stadium, regular ticket price</em>. The Sounds are kicking off another 4-game home series tonight at 7, and the weekend is full of special events. Catch fireworks after the Friday &amp; Saturday games, or chow down on $1 ice cream sundaes on Sunday (get it?). Saturday is also the 4th Purity Faith Night Concert of the season, featuring a pre-game concert by Jaci Velasquez. Can&#x2019;t make it this weekend? The 4th game is on Monday at 7, and it&#x2019;s dollar hot dog night.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=139420779465946\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">OMG Urban Flea Market</a>. </strong><em>Saturday, July 23 from 8am-4pm at Old Made Good (1304 McGavock Pike), free</em>. More than 20 local vendors will showcase their wares at local vintage boutique Old Made Good this Saturday. We went to the inaugural OMG Urban Flea Market a few months ago and stumbled across everything from vintage kitsch to handmade crafts to potted herbs to a milkshake stand. And it&#x2019;s an outdoor event in Nashville, so obviously you can count on a food truck kicking around, plus some musical entertainment.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvillezoo.org/events_detail.asp?eventID=12\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvillezoo.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Ice Day at the Nashville Zoo</a></strong>. <em>Saturday, July 23 from 9am-4pm at the Nashville Zoo, regular admission price</em>. So, has anyone mentioned how hot it is lately? Ice Day is super appealing this year, because of, y&#x2019;know, ice. Any way to beat the heat, we say! Anyway, you can enjoy a day at the zoo plus all things frozen: popsicles for the animals, an ice cream eating contest for the humans, a &#x201C;winter wonderland snow tent&#x201D; (mysterious!) and more.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grassyknollmovies\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Grassy Knoll Movie Night: Harold &amp; Maude</a></strong>. <em>Sunday, July 24, sundown in the side lot next to Bongo Java East, $5 ($4 with canned food donation, $1 for kids)</em>. <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/07/06/grassy-knoll-movie-nights-in-east-nashville-start-this-sunday/\" target=\"_blank\">We&#x2019;ve already told you how excited we are about Grassy Knoll Movie Nights</a>, a new outdoor movie series in East Nashville. This week&#x2019;s film is Harold &amp; Maude, beer will be flowing and pizza will be sizzling, and everyone will be sweating under the stars. Bonding over body odor is part of the fun!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebeccaseung/5396662972/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">rebeccaseung</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/22/the-weekendist-animal-days-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Animal Days Edition\">The Weekendist: Animal Days Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/08/27/the-weekendist-bye-bye-august-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Bye Bye August Edition\">The Weekendist: Bye Bye August Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/05/27/the-weekendist-memorial-day-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Memorializing Edition\">The Weekendist: Memorializing Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/10/02/the-weekendist-full-blown-fall-fest-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Full-Blown Fall Fest Edition\">The Weekendist: Full-Blown Fall Fest Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/07/29/the-weekendist-sparkly-sparkly-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Sparkly Sparkly Edition\">The Weekendist: Sparkly Sparkly Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
