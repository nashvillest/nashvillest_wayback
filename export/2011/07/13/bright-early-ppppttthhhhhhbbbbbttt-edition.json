They also found that while he said he uses it to visit all the county clerk offices, he&#x2019;s actually only visited one of them in the last six months, and only once. Additionally, back when he requested the vehicle, he felt it was necessary to ask for 20-inch wheels, for safety. The good news is that the entire fiasco has made some members of the Metro Council realize that many city vehicles go unused and we could be saving an awful lot of money by simply reimbursing staff for mileage instead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Setting it in stone. </strong>State Rep. Julia Hurley made things kind of weird when <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/15069488/state-lawmaker-carved-initials-in-her-capitol-desk\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">she carved her initials into her wooden desk in the House chamber, admitting she &#x201C;wasn&#x2019;t thinking straight&#x201D; at the time</a>. Needless to say, she&#x2019;ll be footing the bill to fix it.</li>\n<li><strong>A real cluster</strong>. Nashville&#x2019;s new plan for avoiding state takeover of failing schools is to group them all together into their own cluster.
