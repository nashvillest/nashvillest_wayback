Among this year&#x2019;s laws are the removal of the one-year age limit on a child being breastfed in public, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/15009792/stricter-offensive-bumper-sticker-law-takes-effect\" target=\"_blank\">a crackdown on obscene bumperstickers</a> (to our knowledge, TruckNutz&#x2122; are still okay), a sky lantern ban, ads on TDOT emergency trucks, and the removal of words like &#x201C;idiot,&#x201D; &#x201C;lunatic,&#x201D; and &#x201C;mentally retarded&#x201D; from Tennessee code, and that controversial teacher tenure change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free parking program starts today. </strong>Metro is also starting up the green parking program today.

As for the rest of us, we can get our permits by donating to organizations that award carbon offset credits, though we&#x2019;d recommend checking with the Davidson County Clerk first to ensure the organization is eligible.</li>\n<li><strong>Vanderbilt bookstore coming to West End. </strong>The gaping bookstore hole that Borders left at the corner of West End and 35th <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110630/NEWS01/110630006/2275/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">will soon be occupied by Vanderbilt&#x2019;s student bookstore</a>.
