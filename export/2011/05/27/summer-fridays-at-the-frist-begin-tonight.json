Look no further. <a href=\"http://www.fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=249\" target=\"_blank\">Frist Fridays</a> are back, and since they&#x2019;re designed around the Frist&#x2019;s upcoming <em>Warhol Live: Music and Dance in Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Work</em> exhibition, it sounds like this year is going to be a party. On the last Friday of every month during the summer the Frist Center throws a big shindig &#x2013; The galleries are open, but the real party happens out back in the Turner Courtyard with snacks, beverages and live music from 6-9pm.</p>\n<p>The year&#x2019;s first Frist Friday is tonight and features Same As It Ever Was, a Talking Heads tribute band. Bring your lawn chairs and $10 for the adults (under 18 and Frist Center members get in free).</p>\n<p>While we&#x2019;re talking about the Frist, it&#x2019;s also worth noting that they&#x2019;re generously offering free admission to active duty military members and their families all summer as part of the <a href=\"http://www.nea.gov/national/bluestarmuseums/faq.html\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Star Museums</a> program.</p>\n<p><strong>Frist Fridays, the final Friday of each month, 6-9pm, $10 for adults, free for Frist members and under 18</strong></p>\n<p>May 27: Same As It Ever Was &#x2013; Talking Heads Tribute Band<br>\nJune 24: The Long Players<br>\nJuly 29: Studio 54 remix with DJ Ron</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powellizer/605305544/\" target=\"_blank\">Powellizer</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/28/frist-fridays-summer-is-here/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Frist Fridays: Summer Is Here\">Frist Fridays: Summer Is Here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/28/frist-friday-fun-starts-this-weekend-with-danielle-peck/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Frist Friday Fun Starts This Weekend With Danielle Peck\">Frist Friday Fun Starts This Weekend With Danielle Peck</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/23/tounge-twisters-frist-first-free-day-more-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tounge Twisters: Frist First Free Day &amp; More [Freebies]\">Tounge Twisters: Frist First Free Day &amp; More [Freebies]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/26/oprylands-poolapalooza-is-back-for-another-boozy-summer/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Opryland&#x2019;s Poolapalooza Is Back For Another Boozy Summer\">Opryland&#x2019;s Poolapalooza Is Back For Another Boozy Summer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/01/28/free-admission-at-the-frist-center-through-february-19-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Admission At The Frist Center Through February 19 [Freebies]\">Free Admission At The Frist Center Through February 19 [Freebies]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
