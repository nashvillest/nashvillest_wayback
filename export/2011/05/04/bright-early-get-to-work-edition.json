They also found that he uses his county car for liquor store runs and hired his sons into two jobs in the office without posting the positions first. Though he was pretty unapologetic in WSMV&#x2019;s initial interview, he has since publicly apologized and promised to go to work at some point. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/27763908/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Davidson County taxpayers have since been blowing up Mayor Dean&#x2019;s phone, and even Mayor Dean has stated the Torrence needs to work a normal schedule</a>. Several Metro Councilmembers have called for his resignation or removal from office and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110503/NEWS0202/110503059/2275/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">District Attorney Torry Johnson is looking into ways to make that happen</a>. Trouble is, he was just elected to a fifth four-year term.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preds lose in OT. </strong><a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/canucks-cash-behind-play-second-line-led-kesler?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-Sports+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Sports%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The Preds did another overtime dance with the Canucks in last night&#x2019;s Game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals, but eventually lost 3-2</a>. The Canucks currently lead the series 2-1 and Game 4 is on Thursday at Smashville.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspicious package closes down James Robertson. </strong>Metro Police shut down a chunk of James Robertson Parkway yesterday afternoon when an attorney in the Robertson Parkway Tower received a suspicious package. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14565803/suspicious-package-forces-downtown-road-closure\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Turns out the package was legitimately suspicious, as it was a box containing a stack of papers that had been hollowed out and stuffed with a &#x201C;cell phone with wires hanging out of it.</a>&#x201D; It was removed by one of those fancy robot things and Metro Police haven&#x2019;t commented on whether or not it could&#x2019;ve hurt someone.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong><a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/sports/27763392/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Johnson wants to race you</a>, and it&#x2019;s for a good cause &#x2026; The TVA says the <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=26607\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;wpln.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">damage done to its power grid by last week&#x2019;s storms will take months to repair</a> &#x2026; Nashville&#x2019;s fire chief says that <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/27745831/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">our emergency response has improved greatly since the May flood</a> &#x2026; The controversial Sportsplex that Belmont was building in Edgehill <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14564301/renovated-park-reopens-in-edgehill\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">is officially open for business</a> &#x2026; Nashville is <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/2678800b-www.fox17.com.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.fox17.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">working on the mosquito problem</a> on the northside this weekend.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/elaiwill/5626874884/in/pool-715021@N24/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Elaine Williams</a></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/29/bright-early-in-plane-sight-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: In Plane Sight Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: In Plane Sight Edition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/10/titans-and-ravens-and-nascar-oh-my-road-closures/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Titans and Ravens and NASCAR, Oh My!
