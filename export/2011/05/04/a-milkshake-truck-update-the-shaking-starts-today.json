The good news is that they met their goal! The even better news is that Moovers &amp; Shakers will make their grand debut today (Wednesday) at Belmont University. It&#x2019;s Dead Day at Belmont, that glorious day before final exams with no classes so that everyone can study for finals (but we all know that&#x2019;s not happening until at least midnight tonight). They don&#x2019;t have their truck yet, so they&#x2019;ll be sharing with their friends at Pizza Buds as they throw a big party and serve milkshakes on the lawn all day. Join Moovers &amp; Shakers, Pizza Buds and The Grilled Cheeserie today between 12-5pm for some delicious, lactose-loaded truck food and entertainment from their favorite musician friends. We can&#x2019;t promise that you won&#x2019;t feel awkward and out of place on a college campus (for our readers who are post-college, of course), but after you take a peek at Moovers &amp; Shaker&#x2019;s menu for the day, we don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll mind.</p>\n<p>If you miss Moovers &amp; Shakers today, you can catch them on May 21 at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/feastivalnashville\" target=\"_blank\">fEASTival Nashville</a> (and maybe they&#x2019;ll have our Nashvillest shake by then&#x2026; if we can ever decide what to put in it!). We&#x2019;re not sure we can wait that long, so we&#x2019;ll be braving Dead Day (it&#x2019;s not as scary as it sounds) to get shakin&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=171166662938766\" target=\"_blank\">Moovin&#x2019; and Shakin&#x2019; Into Summer</a></strong>. <em>Wednesday, May 4 from 12-5pm, Belmont University South Lawn (just follow the sound of the music).</em></p>\n<p><strong>MENU<br>\n</strong>$3.75 for 16 oz of tasty tasty treats!
