We remember eating snowballs before moving to Tennessee, and were excited to hear that we could finally get them here.</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve never been lucky enough to taste a snowball, do us a favor and <em>please</em> don&#x2019;t confuse it with a snowcone. Snowballs are miles above and beyond those ballpark snowcones we remember from childhood! Snowballs are made from shaved ice, and don&#x2019;t even think about slopping grape, cherry, orange or lime flavoring on the top. At Fleur de Lis, we tried flavors like Wedding Cake, Tiger&#x2019;s Blood, Strawberry Cheesecake and Dreamsicle. And they were all delicious. And we want more. Right now.</p><p>Fleur de Lis Flavors also makes fresh-squeezed lemonade, hot roasted nuts and chocolate covered frozen bananas, making them a very welcome addition to the Farmer&#x2019;s Market. So stop by Fleur de Lis Flavors this weekend. Because right about now, a snowball is sounding <em>really </em>good.</p>"}
