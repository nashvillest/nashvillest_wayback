An Italian composer is in the process of turning Al Gore&#x2019;s <em>Inconvenient Truth</em> documentary <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8406409\" target=\"_blank\">into an opera</a>. He&#x2019;s actually been working on it for a year already, but won&#x2019;t be presenting it until 2011. The film and book will be transformed into a story that&#x2019;s told from different characters&#x2019; perspectives and get this: Al Gore&#x2019;s character is totally going to be in it. We can&#x2019;t imagine what that&#x2019;s going to look or sound like, but man are we ever curious.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/chealion/449235576/\" target=\"_blank\">Chealion</a>.</em></p>"
