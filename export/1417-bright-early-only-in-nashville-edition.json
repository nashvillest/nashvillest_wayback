Smith, and the Jonas Brothers walked into a bar&#x2026;</em> Sounds like the start of a bad joke, doesn&#x2019;t it? It&#x2019;s actually not too far from what happened last night&#x2013;except <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090104/TUNEIN/901050345\" target=\"_blank\">instead of a bar, it was the Ryman Auditorium</a>. The Jonas Brothers performed to a sold-out crowd alongside a hodgepodge of &#x201C;special guests&#x201D; including Smith, McGraw, Faith Hill, Jordin Sparks, Steven Curtis Chapman, Amy Grant, Vince Gill, Martina McBride, Brad Paisley, and Phil Vassar. We hate to admit this, but we kind of wish we were there.</p><ul><li><strong>TVA could be at fault.</strong> New reports have shown that the Tennessee Valley Authority may have <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090104/GREEN02/901040392/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">refused some pretty major repairs</a> that would have likely prevented the coal ash spill that damaged and destroyed over a dozen homes, spewed mercury and arsenic all over the land, and probably leached into the river.</li><li><strong>TIMMY 4 PREZ!!1</strong> Much to the surprise of pretty much everyone, former US Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090105/NEWS02/901050337/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">won&#x2019;t actually be running for governor</a>.
