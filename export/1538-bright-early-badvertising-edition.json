As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures. With Metro schools now looking at being about $16 million in the hole, they&#x2019;re taking a look at some creative ways to bring in the dough&#x2013;the latest of which is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9854079\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">selling advertising space on Metro school buses</a>. It&#x2019;s already legal to sell black and white bus ads in Tennessee, but they think colored ads would entice more businesses to actually buy them. A lot of folks seem to support at least looking into it, but some parents feel like it would be tacky&#x2026; though not as tacky, we think, as a $16 million deficit.</p><ul><li><strong>Ah-CHOO! </strong>Are you one of the lucky folks who <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9851804\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">haven&#x2019;t gotten the flu yet</a>?
