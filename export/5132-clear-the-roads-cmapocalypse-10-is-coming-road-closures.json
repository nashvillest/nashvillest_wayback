But a few things won&#x2019;t be open for our beloved CMApocalypse &#x2013; Namely, roads. We&#x2019;ve got the road closures list here for you, so you can get a head start working on a plan of action if you work, live, or have to go anywhere near downtown in the next week.</p><p><strong>Closed from 11am-2pm only on Wednesday, June 9 for opening day parade:</strong></p><ul><li>First Avenue from Church to Union Streets</li><li>Church Street from First to Third Avenues</li><li>Second Avenue from Demonbreun to Union Streets</li><li>Broadway from Third to Seventh Avenues</li><li>Sixth Avenue from Broadway to Demonbreun</li></ul><p><strong>Closed from Wednesday, June 9 to early the morning of Monday, June 14:</strong></p><ul><li>Closing at 8am: Fifth Avenue from Demonbreun to Broadway</li><li>Closing at 9am: Broadway from First to Second Avenues</li><li>Closing at 9am: First Avenue from Demonbreun to Church Streets</li><li>Closing at 12pm:&#xA0;Broadway from Second to Fourth Avenues</li></ul><p>Second and Third Avenues will remain open, but you won&#x2019;t be able to turn on Broadway, and if you plan on getting anywhere fast, we recommend finding a route with a few less pedestrians.</p><p>Nashville MTA, as might be expected, has a <a href=\"http://www.nashvillemta.org/PDFHomePage/6.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">5-page PDF of detours that can be found here</a>.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re up for a real adventure (and really need to get downtown&#x2026; and really don&#x2019;t want to deal with parking), the free <a href=\"http://www.nashvillemta.org/setpage.asp?page=musiccitycircuit.html\" target=\"_blank\">Music City Circuit</a> bus is your answer.
