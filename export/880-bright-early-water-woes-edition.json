If you were disheartened by the unfortunate news that our power bills could go up by 20% this fall, brace yourselves: Our water and sewer bills are <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8912508\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">going up too</a>. A lot of the water mains, pipes and pumps need to be replaced, and we could see double-digit increases in our water bills soon. But hey, new legislation may give us <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080828/NEWS0201/808280396/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tennessean.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">less annoying bills</a>, so we can&#x2019;t complain. Er&#x2026; yes we can.&#xA0;</p><ul><li><strong>Standoff</strong>. Metro police <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=8914517\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wkrn.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">spent the evening</a> out at a Rivergate hotel trying to convince an attempted murder suspect to come out of his room. Something to write home about for all those tourists staying in the Rivergate Baymont Inn &amp; Suites&#x2026;&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Coffee rage</strong>. Nashville drivers make us pretty angry, but apparently road rage is taking on a different shape in Manchester, TN. A man actually got out of his car at his child&#x2019;s elementary school and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8913218\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">poured his coffee</a> in the window of another car that was ticking him off. And the drama ensues &#x2013; Was it hot or cold? Is the Czeck native in the country legally or not? Blah blah blah&#x2026; We&#x2019;ll have to remember this for the next time someone pulls a U-turn from the far right lane at a red light on Broadway in front of us.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Diamonds are a man&#x2019;s best friend</strong>. Murfreesboro residents, keep an eye out for a cross-dressed man with a <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8914367\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">lot of jewelry</a>. Two men were actually involved in the armed robbery of a jewelry store, but we think one may be easier to spot on the streets than the other.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>. Our homeless population is at an all-time high, but the real kicker is that there are <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/17317717/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wsmv.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">32% more</a> homeless women and children on our streets &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8914302\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Someone&#x2019;s lying</a> in the case of Rutherford County Students Attack Bus Driver, and the school is going to find out &#x2026; The aforementioned case must be putting undue strain on the system in Rutherford County, because they&#x2019;re rebilling residents for tickets&#xA0;that were <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/17322779/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wsmv.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">paid decades ago</a>.&#xA0;</li></ul><div><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/cayusa/330705878/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cayusa</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></div><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/22/world-water-day-walk-for-water-downtown-with-bloodwater-mission/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: World Water Day: Walk For Water Downtown With Blood:Water Mission\">World Water Day: Walk For Water Downtown With Blood:Water Mission</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
