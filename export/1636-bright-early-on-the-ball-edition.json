As the first of the stimulus money starts flowing into Tennessee, the folks at Metro Nashville Public Schools are still waiting for their cut. At $15 million in the hole, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10038327\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wkrn.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">they&#x2019;ll be receiving almost $26 million in extra funding</a> with one catch: It can only be used for Title I, or low-income, programs. Though it probably won&#x2019;t salvage any jobs, it&#x2019;s still good news for us since most of the kids in MNPS are considered low-income (Not-so-fun fact: <a href=\"http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/dec/26/tennessee-students-flood-lunch-assistance-programs/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.knoxnews.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">about 75% of the kids in MNPS use the free and reduced lunch program</a>.) Until they actually receive the money, they won&#x2019;t be making any decisions about what to do with it.</p><ul><li><strong>The Germans are coming.</strong> Our friends over at <a href=\"http://chattarati.com\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/chattarati.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Chattarati</a> have the exclusive report about Volkswagen&#x2019;s announcement today regarding <a href=\"http://chattarati.com/2009/03/20/volkswagen-to-invest-in-tennessee-universities/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/chattarati.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">a possible multimillion-dollar investment in several universities</a> across Tennessee. They&#x2019;ll be covering the press conference today, so stay tuned.</li><li><strong>Pay up.</strong> After Dell announced a new round of layoffs a few weeks ago, the folks in Wilson County are <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18969577/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.wsmv.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">starting to rethink all the tax breaks they gave the corporation</a> to lure them into town. Although Dell promised them 1,000 new jobs, county officials point out that the plant now employs less than 300 people.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Look at us go!
