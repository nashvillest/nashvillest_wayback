Seriously. We came home with bags upon bags of freebies, most notably from Whole Foods. So basically, we can&#x2019;t wait to loot the Earth Day Festival again this year!</p>\n<p>The 2009 Earth Day Festival is themed <em>Together &#x2013; Growing A Greener Nashville </em>and will feature over sixty booths &amp; displays where folks of all ages can browse, learn, participate and maybe even pick up a few freebies! Additionally, the entertainment lineup is solid, featuring local artists Caitlin Rose, Jeremy Lister, AutoVaughn, The Dynamites and headliner Susan Tedeschi.</p>\n<p>A full schedule of the day&#x2019;s performances, workshops, demonstrations and activities can be found <a href=\"http://www.nashvilleearthday.org/index.php?p=21&amp;s=24\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilleearthday.org/index.php?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Earth Day Festival 2009<br>\n</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Saturday, April 18, 2009<br>\n11am-7pm in Centennial Park, free</span></strong></p>"
