The deadline has passed to submit your own, but Saturday kicked off the most important challenge yet: <a href=\"http://www.capturemusiccity.com/news/78\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.capturemusiccity.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Vote Week+3</a>. Between now and next Monday, the folks at CMC want you to get your vote on and here&#x2019;s why:</p><blockquote><p>&#x2026; [W]e&#x2019;re so very close to a million votes cast for the project. We think it would so cool to be able to say that people voted a million times to help shape the book. A million times!!! We&#x2019;re so excited about hitting that mark that we&#x2019;re willing to extend the vote period by a few days to make it happen. How lame would it be to end with 989,000 votes or something. So Vote Week is now officially Vote Week+3.</p></blockquote><p>Once you register, you&#x2019;ll see a <a href=\"http://www.capturemusiccity.com/user/profile\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.capturemusiccity.com&apos;);\">vote graph</a> in your profile that tells what percentage of photos you&#x2019;ve actually voted on. The challenge this week is to get your graph up to 100%. Not only is it a great way to kill time, but you&#x2019;ll get to take a look at some of Nashville&#x2019;s finest photographers.</p><p>Start clicking!</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwage/445632807/in/set-72157594430794608/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">cwage</a>.</em></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/16/capture-music-city-on-the-home-stretch/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Capture Music City: On The Home Stretch\">Capture Music City: On The Home Stretch</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/05/going-green-capture-music-city-mini-challenge/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Going Green: Capture Music City Mini-Challenge\">Going Green: Capture Music City Mini-Challenge</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/17/nashvilles-got-talent-capture-music-city-drops-tonight-shindigs-celebrations/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville&#x2019;s Got Talent!: Capture Music City Drops Tonight [Shindigs &amp; Celebrations]\">Nashville&#x2019;s Got Talent!: Capture Music City Drops Tonight [Shindigs &amp; Celebrations]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/24/out-about-capture-music-city-mini-challenge/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Out &amp; About: Capture Music City Mini-Challenge\">Out &amp; About: Capture Music City Mini-Challenge</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/16/the-other-best-of-toast-of-music-city-voting-ends-june-20/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Other Best-Of: Toast Of Music City Voting Ends June 20\">The Other Best-Of: Toast Of Music City Voting Ends June 20</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
