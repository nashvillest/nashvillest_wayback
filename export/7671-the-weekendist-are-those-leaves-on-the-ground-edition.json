The lineup, put together by everyone&#x2019;s favorite local record store (Grimey&#x2019;s, duh) includes The Coolin&#x2019; System and Turkeys with D. Watusi. As you might guess, there will be food trucks. And raffle prizes! Not too shabby for a free event.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grassyknollmovies?ref=ts\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.facebook.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Grassy Knoll Movie Night: <em>Cool Hand Luke</em></a></strong><em>.
