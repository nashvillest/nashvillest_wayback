The good news is, we love our veterans. The bad news is that most of us aren&#x2019;t off of work while they celebrate. Furthermore, <strong>Broadway will be closed between 8:30am and 1pm from 2nd Avenue all the way down to 18th Avenue</strong>. If you&#x2019;re lucky enough to have the day off and want to get in on the 16 blocks of parade-y goodness, the shindig starts at 11am on 14th Avenue. We hear there might be tanks.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/91829349@N00/297767201/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">rjones0856</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/10/brace-yourselves-for-impact-its-cmapocalypse-09-road-closures10/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Brace Yourselves For Impact: It&#x2019;s Veterans CMApocalypse &#x2019;09 [Road Closures]\">Brace Yourselves For Impact: It&#x2019;s Veterans CMApocalypse &#x2019;09 [Road Closures]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/12/03/on-the-day-of-the-nashville-christmas-parade-metro-gave-to-us-road-closures/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: On The Day Of The Nashville Christmas Parade, Metro Gave To Us [Road Closures]\">On The Day Of The Nashville Christmas Parade, Metro Gave To Us [Road Closures]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/04/tonight-christmas-parade-with-red-noses-john-rich-road-closures/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Christmas Parade With Red Noses &amp; John Rich [Road Closures]\">Christmas Parade With Red Noses &amp; John Rich [Road Closures]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/07/01/happy-4th-we-hope-you-know-your-back-roads-road-closures/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy 4th: We Hope You Know Your Back Roads [Road Closures]\">Happy 4th: We Hope You Know Your Back Roads [Road Closures]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/07/clear-the-roads-cmapocalypse-10-is-coming-road-closures/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Clear The Roads: CMApocalypse &#x2019;10 Is Coming [Road Closures]\">Clear The Roads: CMApocalypse &#x2019;10 Is Coming [Road Closures]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
