Cheekwood&#x2019;s hours are 9:30am-4:30pm today. We have to admit, we&#x2019;re pretty jealous that we have to be at work instead of outside wandering through some beautiful botanical gardens, but such is life. Enjoy it for us, okay? <em>Thanks to Michele for the tip</em>!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniperberry/533569524/\" target=\"_blank\">jcbonbon</a>.</em></p>"
