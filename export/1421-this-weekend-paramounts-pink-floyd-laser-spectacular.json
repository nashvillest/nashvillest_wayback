Or at least your week. Or maybe not hallucinatory at all, but at least pretty trippy and slightly cool. The 23-year-old laser show claims to present the music of Pink Floyd in a completely different light (no pun intended). <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B004138D1334DF8?artistid=834281&amp;majorcatid=10005&amp;minorcatid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Tickets are available</a> for $27 and $29, and the show is at TPAC at 8pm on Friday.&#xA0;</p><p><em>Photo from </em><a href=\"http://www.laserspectacular.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>laserspectacular.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>"}
