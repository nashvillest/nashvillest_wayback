Over the past few months, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/?s=%22va+hospital%22\" target=\"_blank\">we&#x2019;ve been following the story</a> of three VA hospitals, including one in Murfreesboro, that may have infected dozens of veterans with HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C through the use of contaminated medical equipment. VA officials are slated to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/14/va-may-have-exposed-10000_n_215400.html\" target=\"_blank\">testify at a congressional hearing in DC in hopes of finding out who was responsible for the mistake</a>. As many as 10,000 veterans have been advised to get tested for the diseases and 6 ended up testing positive for HIV, 16 for Hepatitis B, and 34 for Hepatitis C. Though some folks are saying that the veterans likely had the diseases before the contamination, Congress isn&#x2019;t quite convinced.</p><ul><li><strong>Save our schools. </strong>The school board is starting to get a little nervous about test scores coming back next month, <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/test-scores-determine-metro-schools-nclb-grade-and-who-will-lead\" target=\"_blank\">which will determine whether the school system meets No Child Left Behind guidelines</a>. If they don&#x2019;t measure up to the federal benchmarks, the Tennessee Department of Education will be taking some pretty drastic measures to restructure.
