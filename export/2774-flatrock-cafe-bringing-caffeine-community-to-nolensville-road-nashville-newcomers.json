Flatrock Cafe serves a <a href=\"http://www.flatrockcafe.net/menu.htm\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flatrockcafe.net&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">simple menu</a> of sandwiches, paninis, salads and soups at incredibly reasonable prices, and we&#x2019;ve heard reports that the food is quite tasty. They also serve locally-roasted coffee, locally-farmed milk, and our favorite&#x2026; Locally brewed Yazoo beer. Can&#x2019;t go wrong there!</p>\n<p>Owner Ronnie Haislip is excited about bringing the cafe concept to the neighborhood, and wants Flatrock Cafe to be a place where the community can come together. Bring the dog and enjoy their giant new deck, hole up with a laptop inside, or come sit and enjoy local music. Flatrock Cafe is open from 6am-2:30pm (or later), with additional evening hours for live music performances. You can find them at 2624 Nolensville Pike, or online at <a href=\"http://www.flatrockcafe.net\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flatrockcafe.net&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">flatrockcafe.</a>net.</p>\n<p>Already been to Flatrock Cafe?
