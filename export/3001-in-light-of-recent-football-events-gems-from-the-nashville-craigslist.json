Our season may be over, but our schedule is not. Cheerleaders with football knowledge will be considered. Apply in person at LP Field Monday morning 8am.</em></p>\n<p><em> </em><em>NOTE: It has been suggested that we can begin recruiting at the preschool age so that they can play by age 5 and therefore we may stand a better chance of winning a game. It has been proven that the local Murfreesboro and Nashville peewee players show much more promise at holding on to the ball when enticed with promises of candy after a successful game perhaps the older players could be persuaded with similar incentives. It has also been suggested that the list of eligible players be amended to include the local school for deaf and blind (no offense here, by any means). This will certainly be considered since deaf children are more apt not to be distracted by the loud noises (booing, etc) on game day and blind children wont be distracted by scantilly clad cheerleaders. More suggestions welcome&#x2026;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/01/27/paper-triangle-football-champs-this-is-your-calling/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Paper Triangle Football Champs, This Is Your Calling&#x2026;\">Paper Triangle Football Champs, This Is Your Calling&#x2026;</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/16/very-ugly-painting-for-sale-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Very Ugly Painting For Sale [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Very Ugly Painting For Sale [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/05/leggo-my-eggo-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Leggo My Eggo [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Leggo My Eggo [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/19/gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist-money-cant-buy-love/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Money Can&#x2019;t Buy Love\">Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Money Can&#x2019;t Buy Love</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/01/dont-be-fooled-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Don&#x2019;t Be Fooled [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Don&#x2019;t Be Fooled [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
