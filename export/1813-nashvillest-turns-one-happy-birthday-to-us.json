April 2009 was by far our best month, when our traffic mysteriously <em>tripled </em>and has been holding steady ever since. It goes without saying (but we&#x2019;ll say it anyway) that we couldn&#x2019;t have done it without a great group of friends, readers, subscribers, Twitter followers and tipsters offering us help and encouragement at every turn along the way. Seriously, we can&#x2019;t thank y&#x2019;all enough! Nashvillest has turned into something much bigger than we could have ever imagined, and we&#x2019;re incredibly excited for year number two. We have some big plans in store, so stay tuned!</p><p>PS: If you want to give us a birthday present, we have the perfect idea. Think of one or two people you know that might find Nashvillest useful, and drop them a line about us! Just don&#x2019;t spam your friends.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/cgrantham/3276015146/\" target=\"_blank\">cgrantham</a>. </em></p>"}
