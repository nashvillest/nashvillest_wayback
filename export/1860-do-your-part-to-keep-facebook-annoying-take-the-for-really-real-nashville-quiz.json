It even tells us that we&#x2019;re &#x201C;up to the minute on where it&#x2019;s at &amp; where it used to be.&#x201D; What a relief!&#xA0;</p>\n<p>While we were there, we took the <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/hownashvillearey/quiz/questions\" target=\"_blank\">How Nashville Are You? Facebook Quiz</a> just for laughs, and it was embarrassingly easy. It validated us as &#x201C;True Nashvillians,&#x201D; and we went on our way with peace of mind. (Fine, so we stopped to take the <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/whatfruitisyoubg/\" target=\"_blank\">What Fruit Is You? Facebook Quiz</a> on our way out. Really, trust us on this one &#x2013; just do it.)</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re up for the challenge, take <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/theforreallyreal/quiz/questions\" target=\"_blank\">The For Really Real Nashville Facebook Quiz</a> and let us know how you stack up.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
