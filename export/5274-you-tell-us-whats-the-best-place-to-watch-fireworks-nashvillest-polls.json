Reader <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rebeccasjones/status/17340078462\" target=\"_blank\">@rebeccasjones</a> wants to know: <strong>What&#x2019;s the best place in Nashville to watch the fireworks display this 4th of July</strong>? Is it from one of the bridges? Is it Love Circle, despite a certain giant square abode? Or do you have a special rooftop spot that we&#x2019;re not allowed to know about (we&#x2019;ll only tell a few people, we promise&#x2026;)</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re partial to parking on the east side and catching the show from either the pedestrian bridge or the Woodland Street bridge, but we know there are some good non-downtown spots with a clear view and a lot less traffic. So fill us (and our readers) in!</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: We&#x2019;re getting some great suggestions in the comments and on Twitter, including the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/YazooBrew/status/17356362335\" target=\"_blank\">Adventure Science Center</a>, the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jonmhyde/status/17351382992\" target=\"_blank\">downtown Hilton&#x2019;s balcony</a>, on a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/nashvillepix/status/17352382790\" target=\"_blank\">private office rooftop</a> (lucky!), the Belmont parking garage, downtown churches and more! Keep &#x2018;em coming.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/clementlivolsi/4739876724/\" target=\"_blank\">Cl&#xE9;ment Livolsi</a>.</em></p>"
