The drama over the convention center and the $450,000 in PR spending escalated at last night&#x2019;s Metro Council meeting. Councilman Mike Jameson got up at the beginning of the meeting during the time traditionally set aside for minor announcements and <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/jameson-drops-bombshell-council-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">delivered a scathing speech which, among other things, accused PR firm McNeely Piggot &amp; Fox of inappropriately lobbying the councilmembers</a>. He also managed to call out the finance department for knowing that the outrageous spending was going on and the <em>Tennessean</em> of deceiving readers by allowing the firm to ghost-write a convention center article. At the end of it, he declared that fighting back against the city&#x2019;s most influential PR firm would probably mean the end of his career.</p><ul><li><strong>More controversy</strong>. The non-discrimination ordinance also came up again at last night&#x2019;s meeting, stirred up another flurry of debate, and <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/council-delays-nondiscrimination-bill\" target=\"_blank\">was pushed back while the sponsors are able to answer other councilmembers&#x2019; questions</a>.</li><li><strong>New in town.</strong> Some folks are upset over a new strip club that will be opening up where Ken&#x2019;s Gold Club used to be.
