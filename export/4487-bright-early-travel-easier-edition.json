The folks at BNA are &#x201C;planning for and making&#xA0;accommodations&#xA0;for&#x201D; this new law to go into effect, and though we&#x2019;re not sure which accommodations one would make for&#xA0;<em>not</em> stranding passengers on the runway for three hours, they assure us that they&#x2019;re ready.</p><ul><li><strong>Preds to the playoffs. </strong>The <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/breaking-down-predators-playoff-chances-against-chicago?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-Sports+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Sports)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Preds head to Chicago tonight for Game 1 of the NHL playoffs and <em>City Paper</em> has a breakdown of the match-up</a>.
