The State of Tennessee is cracking down on its employees&#x2019; bad habits by <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/04/02/state-employees-need-to-stop-smoking-by-june-1st/\" target=\"_blank\">charging them 50 bucks if they can&#x2019;t quit smoking by October 1</a>. The new mandate goes for all state employees and spouses who are covered under the state health insurance plan. And for those needing a little extra help stepping away from the cigs, they&#x2019;ll be providing counseling, drugs (crack?), and nicotine gum. So after y&#x2019;all smoke your way through the cartons of cigarettes you bought this week before the tax hike, it may be time to give quitting a try.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Tennessee Department of Transportation is shelling out $5.7 million (don&#x2019;t worry, it&#x2019;s not stimulus money) to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090403/NEWS01/904030378/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">replace some of the wetlands they&#x2019;ve destroyed with all that pesky road construction</a>. How does one go about replacing wetlands, you ask? We have no idea.</li>\n<li>A Bridgestone/Firestone shop <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090403/NEWS01/904030386/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">seems to have gotten the worst of the damage from a tornado that tore down Murfreesboro Road</a> in South Nashville yesterday. Store employees (including the guy whose truck the building collapsed on) were already cracking jokes about it, though, so we guess it could&#x2019;ve been worse?</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> The TVA rate cut we mentioned yesterday could <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090403/NEWS01/904030374/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">save you around $4-9 per month</a> &#x2026; Metro is asking the Department of Justice for some grant money to <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10122788\" target=\"_blank\">hire more officers</a> &#x2026; TDOT will be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090402/NEWS09/90402022/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">shutting down parts of I-40</a> this weekend, so check the schedule before you plan your trip.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/cgrantham/2675091275/in/pool-nashvillest/\" target=\"_blank\">cgrantham</a>.</em></p>"
