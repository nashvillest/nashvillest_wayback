The block of dates kicks off with a Regions Free Day of Music at the Schermerhorn on May 22, and if you&#x2019;ve never been to free day at the symphony, you&#x2019;re in for a treat. Previously held in the fall, Regions Free Day of Music will feature dozens of performances in every nook and cranny of the Symphony Center, showcasing every style of music imaginable and capping off with a free Nashville Symphony performance in the main Laura Turner Concert Hall.</p>\n<p>The rest of the summer will see the Nashville Symphony heading outdoors to perform at parks around the area for their annual lineup of free Regions Community Concerts.
