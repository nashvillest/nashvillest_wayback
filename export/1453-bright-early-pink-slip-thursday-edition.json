This is how we hate to start the morning, but layoff news just keeps rolling in. This time, we&#x2019;ve come full circle to another round of state job cuts. You might remember the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/25/bright-early-limited-access-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">first round of buyouts and layoffs back in June</a> where about 2,300 state employees lost their jobs, and this time we&#x2019;re looking at another 2,000. Governor Bredesen has vowed to do what he can to minimize the damage, but he also tells us that the state is in its <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090115/NEWS0201/901150332/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">worst financial crisis since World War II</a>. He&#x2019;s looking at options like four-day work weeks and that whole <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28660361/\" target=\"_blank\">forced-vacation thing</a> that Gannett is doing, but it doesn&#x2019;t look real promising.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not exactly transparent.</strong> Eric Crafton and the English First group that&#x2019;s backing him <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=65418\" target=\"_blank\">probably won&#x2019;t be disclosing financial records</a> as is required by the Election Commission before an election. Apparently they&#x2019;ve been calling around Davidson County trying to find out what would happen if they miss today&#x2019;s deadline. Many folks suspect it&#x2019;s because of the group&#x2019;s probable financial ties to known racist groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Down and out.</strong> As the temperatures dip down to 5 degrees tonight, be sure to think of the folks in Middle Tennessee who <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9676391\" target=\"_blank\">don&#x2019;t have heat</a>. And there are plenty of them.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> A new phone poll of WSMV shows the English Only election to be <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18482103/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">neck-in-neck</a> &#x2026; You want <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/01/12/daily33.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">whiter teeth</a>?
