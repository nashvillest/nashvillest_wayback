We&#x2019;ve watched them go from playing for a handful of people at the French Quarter Cafe to playing for thousands on the Adele tour and selling out theaters on their own, and we&#x2019;re pretty dang proud that Nashvillians can claim we-heard-them-first bragging rights. <a href=\"http://www.ryman.com/event/detail/civilwars.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tickets go on sale Friday, October 21</a> and you can bet we&#x2019;ll be first in line.</p><p><em>Photo from <a href=\"http://tcwtour.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Civil Wars Tour Diary</a>. </em></p>"}
