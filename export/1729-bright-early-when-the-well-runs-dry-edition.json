If you&#x2019;re reading this from work this morning, you&#x2019;re pretty lucky. The Tennessee unemployment rate hit 9.6% last month and economists predict it won&#x2019;t be getting better anytime soon. Consequently, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090417/BUSINESS01/904170380/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">more than 7,0000 Tennesseans are reaching the end of their 59 weeks of Federal unemployment benefits</a>. If we continue losing our jobs at this rate, the state&#x2019;s Labor Department predicts that as many as 57,000 more Tennesseans could exhaust their benefits by July 4. Though Congress already tacked on 33 weeks of benefits last year, there&#x2019;s talk of using some of the stimulus funding to add another 20 weeks.</p><ul><li><strong>Seriously?
