We know, we know, we talk about this weather a lot, but&#x2026; Isn&#x2019;t it amazing? Enjoy a weekend free of slush and ice (unless it&#x2019;s in the form of a frozen treat) and if you&#x2019;re looking for something fun to do, our top picks are below.</p>\n<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillefarmersmarket.org/event/night_market\" target=\"_blank\">Night Market</a></strong>. <em>Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market, 6-8pm, free admission (just pay for the goodies!)</em>. We&#x2019;ve raved about how much we love the idea of Night Market before, but January&#x2019;s event was the first we had the good fortune of actually attending. It didn&#x2019;t disappoint. A packed house at the farmer&#x2019;s market grazed tables with local cheese samples, boozy hot chocolate (and homemade marshmallows) and ate their fill of BBQ, gyros and naan. This month&#x2019;s Night Market will feature more of the same, plus the return of Fleur de Lis Flavors, The Green Bag Lady and more! Tip: Bring cash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://grimeys.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Over The Rhine Instore</a></strong>. <em>Grimey&#x2019;s, 5pm, free</em>. Before they take the stage at 3rd &amp; Lindsley on Sunday night, Over the Rhine will be playing an instore at Grimey&#x2019;s this Saturday. The instore is free, but the Girl Scouts will also be there peddling their delicious cookies. Basically, you need to prepare for a wallop in the wallet (who can resist those Girl Scouts and their cookies? Not us).</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=923\" target=\"_blank\">Vishnu: Hinduism&#x2019;s Blue-Skinned Savior at the Frist</a></strong><em>. Frist Center, 10am-5:30pm, free. </em>Saturday marks the last day of the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/01/28/free-admission-at-the-frist-center-through-february-19-freebies/\" target=\"_blank\">almost month-long run of free admission at the Frist</a>, so if you haven&#x2019;t taken advantage of it yet, what are you waiting for?! Saturday also includes a free community preview of the Frist&#x2019;s new exhibition, <em>Vishnu: Hinduism&#x2019;s Blue-Skinned Savior</em>. Hear the curator&#x2019;s perspective on the exhibit at 11am, and watch an accompanying dance performance at 1pm.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.1045thezone.com/sectional.asp?id=39492\" target=\"_blank\">104-5 The Zone&#x2019;s SportsFest</a></strong>. <em>Nashville Convention Center, 8am-5pm, $5</em>. From NASCAR to football to hockey, there&#x2019;s something for every sports fan at Sportsfest. Speakers include NASCAR driver Sterling Marlin, UT Head Football Coach Derek Dooley, brand-new head coach of the Tennessee Titans Mike Munchak and more.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B004503A08935B7?artistid=805978&amp;majorcatid=10004&amp;minorcatid=9&amp;camefrom=CFC_PREDATORS\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Predators vs. Phoenix Coyotes</a></strong>. <em>Bridgestone Arena, 7pm, ticket prices vary</em>. Cheer on the Preds as they face the Coyotes for the final time this season. We&#x2019;ve only got a couple months left of hockey season, so be sure to catch a game or two before it&#x2019;s over!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://nashvillefarmersmarket.org/event/swing_dance_at_the_nashville_farmers_market\" target=\"_blank\">Swing Dance at the Farmer&#x2019;s Market</a></strong>. <em>Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market, 1-4pm, free</em>. It&#x2019;s quite the busy weekend at the Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market. Lace up your shoes and get your swing dancing on inside the Market House this Sunday afternoon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/39296163@N08/5437174662/\" target=\"_blank\">hikeandhistory</a>.</em></p>"
