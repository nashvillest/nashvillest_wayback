We&#x2019;re running short on time this morning, so here&#x2019;s your abbreviated Bright &amp; Early:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our weather alerts are flashing this morning about a possible dusting of snow today. Exciting, right? There&#x2019;s also a possibly larger system on the way for Sunday night and Monday.

The rescuers also noted that it was good practice for when more sinkholes open up and swallow humans.

The funding that usually covers extra Metro police officers during that time was cut, meaning they didn&#x2019;t have the resources to patrol as much as they normally do.
