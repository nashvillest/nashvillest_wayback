But fear not, oh smirking Prius driver &#x2013; now you can drive in the HOV lane, even if you&#x2019;re commuting solo. You are superior once again! But before you fly past traffic on I-65 during rush hour today, take some time to <a href=\"http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/smartcommute/docs/draftHOVlaneExemption.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">apply for your HOV Smart Pass</a>, a bright green sticker that you must affix to your shiny hybrid before you have the right to ride in the HOV lane. And not all hybrids qualify, nay, most hybrids do not qualify. <a href=\"http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/smartcommute/docs/draftHOVlaneExemption.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to see if your hybrid is on the list of qualifying low-emission vehicles.

(We kid, we kid &#x2013; We&#x2019;re just picking on hybrid owners because we&#x2019;re jealous that we can&#x2019;t afford them.)</p>"
