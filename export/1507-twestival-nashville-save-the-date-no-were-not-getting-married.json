If you&#x2019;ve ever been to a Tweet-up, a Geek Breakfast, Barcamp or Podcamp, you&#x2019;re probably familiar with the great community that many of us have found through Twitter. And we&#x2019;re confident that our great community can make great things happen, which is why we&#x2019;re having a Twestival.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sounds like short notice? Well, it definitely is&#x2026; We got started on this less than 12 hours ago! And that&#x2019;s why we need YOUR help to make Nashville&#x2019;s Twestival a success.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">How you can help:</p><ul><li><strong>Save the date</strong>. Commit to coming to Nashville&#x2019;s Twestival on Thursday, February 12, 2009.</li><li><strong>Help us plan</strong>. If you have connections to venues, performers, sponsors, caterers, giveaways, etc&#x2026; We need your help! If you don&#x2019;t have any connections&#x2026; We need your help too! All we need are a bunch of willing hands. Which brings us to&#x2026;</li><li><strong>Join the team. </strong>If you can commit some time (it doesn&#x2019;t have to be much), we&#x2019;ll be having several planning meetings over the next two weeks and we&#x2019;re extending the invitation to anyone who wants to help out. Email info@twestivalnashville.com with your name, email address, phone number, twitter name and any special skills, knowledge or hookups that might help out. Our first meeting is this coming Monday at 6:30pm.</li><li><strong>Spread the word. </strong>We know that most of you don&#x2019;t have time to help us coordinate the event. But you can still help! Spread the word on your blog, your twitter, your facebook, at your school, at your church, at your workplace. Everyone can support a good cause, right?</li></ul><p>Our specific needs right now are: <strong>VOLUNTEERS</strong>, a <strong>venue</strong>, <strong>performers</strong>, <strong>sponsors </strong>to donate prizes and food (and drinks, wink wink!), <strong>graphic design </strong>for some promo materials and a logo, <strong>printing </strong>for posters and flyers, and <strong>friends </strong>who will spread the word far and wide, beyond the crowd that we can reach by ourselves.
