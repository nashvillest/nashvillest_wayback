Not only is it their 8th birthday (and we certainly hope it&#x2019;s a happy one), but they&#x2019;re giving Nashville the birthday present and offering <a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=625\" target=\"_blank\">free admission all day</a>! So from 10am-5:30pm today, drop in them and give them your best wishes (and you might as well browse around a bit). Too bad they haven&#x2019;t mentioned anything about birthday cake&#x2026;</p><p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mollyeh11/2585539325/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>mollyeh11</em></a><em>. </em></p>"}
