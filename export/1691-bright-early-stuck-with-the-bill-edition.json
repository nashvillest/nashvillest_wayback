Though lots of folks are fans of the new convention center, they have a lot of concerns about who&#x2019;s going to end up footing the bill. There&#x2019;s been talk of paying for construction out of property taxes, but Mayor Dean is going on record to say that Nashville taxpayers shouldn&#x2019;t have to be the ones paying for it. After <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090408/NEWS01/904080416/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Mayor Dean filed an amendment prohibiting the use of property taxes</a>, Metro Finance Director Rich Riebeling told the <em>Tennessean </em>that they&#x2019;re planning instead to target tourists with taxes and fees and if that doesn&#x2019;t cover it, &#x201C;we shouldn&#x2019;t do the project.&#x201D;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disease at Vandy. </strong>A Vanderbilt freshman was <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/2ab5b2aa-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">hospitalized last night with meningococcal bacterial meningitis</a>, which is a highly contageous and life-threatening disease for which most of us are supposed to be vaccinated. So, Vandy folks, pay close attention to your school alerts and hope it doesn&#x2019;t spread.</li>\n<li><strong>House to vote on abortion bill. </strong>The Tennessee House will vote on an amendment today that would <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090408/NEWS0201/904080418/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">let voters sound off on greater restrictions for abortions</a>. Supporters have been trying to pass the bill for years, but this is the furthest it&#x2019;s ever gotten.</li>\n<li><strong>Moby Teeth the Movie.</strong> <em>Pith In The Wind</em> brings us the actual <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2009/04/shoot_the_messenger_toby_keith.php\" target=\"_blank\">video footage of Toby Keith&#x2019;s now-famous ACM meltdown</a>.</li>\n<li>Bits &amp; pieces.
