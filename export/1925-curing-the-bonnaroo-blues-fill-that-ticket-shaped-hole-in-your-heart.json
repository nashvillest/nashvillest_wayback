Everyone&#x2019;s cutting back on spending, and that may mean that you trimmed away your trip to Bonnaroo this year. Ouch. We feel your pain, but don&#x2019;t worry! Missing out on the real deal shouldn&#x2019;t stop you from creating your own Bonnaroo-ish experience right here in town this weekend.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>GRIMEY&#x2019;S &amp; BEYOND</strong></p><p>Tonight (Thursday) at 6pm at <a href=\"http://grimeys.com/news.html\" target=\"_blank\">Grimey&#x2019;s</a>, now-locals <strong>The Bittersweets</strong> will be playing an in-store set, and you can catch the mini-show while you drown your sorrows in free beer from their label. Seriously. On Saturday, show up early for <strong>Andrew Bird&#x2019;s</strong> in-store set at 1pm. He&#x2019;s passing through for Bonnaroo, but seeing him free at Grimeys sounds better than battling traffic, mud, and busting open the piggy bank. Word on the street is that there may even be a few surprises throughout the weekend over at Grimey&#x2019;s. Stay tuned.&#xA0;</p><p>Don&#x2019;t forget <strong><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/26/oprylands-poolapalooza-is-back-for-another-boozy-summer/\" target=\"_blank\">Poolapalooza</a></strong> on Friday, featuring <strong>Sons of William</strong>.

Drop a significantly smaller chunk of change on some shows in town this weekend, and we bet you&#x2019;ll forget all about the massive amount of fun happening without you in Manchester (but we&#x2019;re, uh, not putting money on that bet).&#xA0;</p><p><em>Thursday</em>: <a href=\"http://mercylounge.com/main.php?em781=191557_-2__0_~0~1523_-1_6_2009_0_0&amp;content=calendar\" target=\"_blank\">St. Vincent with Pattern Is Movement</a>&#xA0;at the Mercy Lounge, $12.&#xA0;<br><em>Friday</em>: <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B00429683B33F56?artistid=731746&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=4\" target=\"_blank\">Etta James &amp; The Roots Band</a>&#xA0;at Arrington Vineyard, tickets start at $49 (yikes).<br><em>Saturday</em>: <a href=\"http://mercylounge.com/main.php?em781=191711_-2__0_~0~1523_-1_6_2009_0_0&amp;content=calendar\" target=\"_blank\">Bonnaroo Refugee Camp Show For The Ticketless</a> (did they read our minds?) at the Mercy Lounge, $5-8; <a href=\"http://music.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music.showDetails&amp;friendid=76305411&amp;Band_Show_ID=38554901\" target=\"_blank\">Shoot The Mountain, Jasmin Caset and Johnny Corndawg</a> at the Five Spot, $5.&#xA0;</p><p>After all that, if we can&#x2019;t drag you from the depths of despair&#x2026; You&#x2019;re on your own.&#xA0;</p>"}
