The appropriately-named &#x201C;Music City Madness&#x201D; contest is back for a third round on CMT.com. From <a href=\"http://www.cmt.com/interact/music_city_madness/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.cmt.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">CMT.com</a>:&#xA0;</p>\n<blockquote><p>The search is on for the next Music City Madness winner.&#xA0;CMT.com offers the ultimate competition for unsigned artists and musicians representing the broad range of country music genres. The winner will fly to Nashville to tape their own Unplugged at Studio 330 performance and for their own private showcase with A&amp;R executives from Warner Bros. Records Nashville. Plus, Grammy-award winning artist Randy Travis will mentor the winner. This contest could be your big chance, so find out how to submit your video. But don&#x2019;t wait. The deadline for your submission is Oct. 6, 2008. Send your performance today and get on the road to Music City.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Previous winners include&#xA0;Stephanie Beck Williams and&#xA0;Katelyn Jolley (who just happens to be 13 years old as well). Yeah, we&#x2019;ve never heard of them either.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/24/out-about-capture-music-city-mini-challenge/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Out &amp; About: Capture Music City Mini-Challenge\">Out &amp; About: Capture Music City Mini-Challenge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/17/nashvilles-got-talent-capture-music-city-drops-tonight-shindigs-celebrations/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville&#x2019;s Got Talent!: Capture Music City Drops Tonight [Shindigs &amp; Celebrations]\">Nashville&#x2019;s Got Talent!: Capture Music City Drops Tonight [Shindigs &amp; Celebrations]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/22/win-win-win-nashville-loves-contests/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Win, Win, Win: Nashville Loves Contests\">Win, Win, Win: Nashville Loves Contests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/16/capture-music-city-on-the-home-stretch/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Capture Music City: On The Home Stretch\">Capture Music City: On The Home Stretch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/02/the-tennesseans-toast-of-music-is-back-for-another-crispy-year/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Tennessean&#x2019;s Toast Of Music City Is Back For Another Crispy Year\">The Tennessean&#x2019;s Toast Of Music City Is Back For Another Crispy Year</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
