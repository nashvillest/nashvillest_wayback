We finally went to the Country Music Hall of Fame last year on <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/24/smithsonian-magazine-museum-day-2008-freebies/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum Day</a>, and it was pretty cool. There&#x2019;s still a bunch of places that we haven&#x2019;t hit up yet, but we&#x2019;ll be crossing a couple more off the list in the very near future, thanks to these new-year specials.</p>\n<p>Admission to <a href=\"http://www.cheekwood.org/Visitors/Hours_and_Admission.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Cheekwood Botanical Garden &amp; Museum Of Art</a> is only $1 per person for the entire month of January! Regular price is a whopping $10.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Admission to <a href=\"http://www.thehermitage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hermitage</a> between now and the end of February is 50% off with a canned food donation to <a href=\"http://www.secondharvestnashville.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Second Harvest Food Bank</a> (Tennessee residents only, <em>via </em><a href=\"http://webbspunideas.blogspot.com/2009/01/tennessee-resident-discount-at.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Webbspun Ideas</em></a>). Regular admission price is $17, so we&#x2019;re looking at $8.50 now (which, let&#x2019;s face it, is still sort of pricey).&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/crashmattb/2397662012/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>crashmattb</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
