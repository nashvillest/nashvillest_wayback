If you&#x2019;ve lived here long enough, you may even have your own story about one of them (yes, that&#x2019;s your cue to leave them in the comments.)</p>\n<p>But we often forget about Al Gore, of <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21262661/\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Prize</a> and vice presidential fame. That&#x2019;s why we had to laugh when we were digging through <a href=\"http://www.rottenneighbor.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rotten Neighbor</a> and found his Belle Meade mansion flagged red for &#x201C;rotten&#x201D; by a user who had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"ls_contents-0\"> This is one of the many homes of Al &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;Charlatan&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; Gore. Not the largest house in Nashville, but according to public records, the top consumer of electricity [of] any other residence. Perhaps it&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s the more than 12,000 square feet of living space for he and Tipper. Perhaps it&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s the heated outdoor pool. Or perhaps it&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s the ice maker that works overtime to make all the little cubes that he plans to take with him to hell for architecting the greatest lie of all times, man-induced global warming.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>At the rate things are going, John Rich may soon be joining Gore on the map if he follows through with the plans for the &#x201C;Villa Rich&#x201D; <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">monstrosity</span> mansion on Love Circle. Though the building group has <a href=\"http://www.principlebuildinggroup.com/projects/VillaRich.php\" target=\"_blank\">yanked the renderings</a> &#x201C;at the request of the client,&#x201D; we still managed to find <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/villarichweb2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">this drawing</a> of what the home is supposed to look like that completely explains why the neighbors are upset.</p>"
