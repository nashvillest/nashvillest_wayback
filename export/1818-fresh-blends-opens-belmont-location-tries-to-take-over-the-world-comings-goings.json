Since the first location set up shop in East Nashville last year, their tasty smoothies and juices have quickly become a Nashvillest favorite. Also, <strong>the first 50 customers at the new store today get $50 in Fresh Blends coupons</strong>, which shouldn&#x2019;t be too difficult given the whole torrential downpour situation. And trust us, they&#x2019;re great coupons&#x2013;your Nashvillest editors were there when the doors opened!</p><p>For the uninitiated, Fresh Blends is an independent, locally owned juice and smoothie bar. They use real fruit, avoid the sugar, and let you build and customize your smoothie whichever way you want it in addition to offering over a dozen concoctions of their own. And while the smoothies are awesome, it&#x2019;s the juice that really sets these folks apart. What do you get when you throw fresh carrots, lemons, beets and ginger into a juicer? Basically the nectar of the gods.</p><p>So bust out your ponchos and pay them a visit this morning (and tell them that Nashvillest sent you!) They&#x2019;ll be open until 8pm today and they&#x2019;re located at 1703 Portland Ave. right next to the new(ish) Subway.</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/13/more-smoothies-please-fresh-blends-to-open-belmont-location/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: More Smoothies, Please: Fresh Blends To Open Belmont Location\">More Smoothies, Please: Fresh Blends To Open Belmont Location</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/18/fresh-blends-exits-east-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends Exits East [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Fresh Blends Exits East [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/01/08/fresh-blends-blending-no-more-comings-goings/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends: Blending No More [Comings &amp; Goings]\">Fresh Blends: Blending No More [Comings &amp; Goings]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/30/nashville-newcomers-fresh-blends-juice-smoothie-bar/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar\">Nashville Newcomers: Fresh Blends Juice &amp; Smoothie Bar</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/07/fresh-blends-turns-to-crepes-to-solidify-juicebar-menu/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fresh Blends Turns To Cr&#xEA;pes To Solidify Juicebar Menu\">Fresh Blends Turns To Cr&#xEA;pes To Solidify Juicebar Menu</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
