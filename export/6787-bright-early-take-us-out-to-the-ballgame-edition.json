We&#x2019;re running short on time this morning, so you know the drill. Your abbreviated Bright &amp; Early:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Happy opening day, baseball fans! Not that we have any major league teams around here to follow, but at least a few of us limped into Nashville from other parts of the country with our baseball obsession intact.

By law, offenders are supposed to purchase the device themselves, but if they can&#x2019;t afford it, then taxpayers foot the bill.

Many of the pups may be up for adoption as early as next week.
