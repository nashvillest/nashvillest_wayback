After a bit of a kerfuffle with the previous management, I Dream of Weenie was shuttered this winter and had remained a sad, empty sight until the past few weeks, when new owner Leslie Allen hauled it out and spiffed it up with a fresh coat of paint and new parking space. You can now find the weenerie proudly parked at 113 South 11th Street, right next to Bongo Java and across from Beyond the Edge and Pied Piper Creamery.</p><p>The new Weenie will keep the same beloved menu items, but the new ownership is looking forward to experimenting with the daily special. Think mac &#x2018;n cheese weenie, Cuban black bean weenie, BLT weenie, and old favorite specials like the Greek weenie, muffalletta weenie, pesto weenie and pizza weenie. There will also be a whole wheat bun added to the menu.</p><p>Thanks to the new location with more foot traffic, I Dream of Weenie will now be able to stay open a little later on the weekends. They&#x2019;ll be serving year round Tuesday &#x2013; Thursday&#xA0;10:30am-3:30pm and Friday &#x2013; Saturday 10:30am-7:30pm. Special summer events with other local businesses are in the works, and they hope to stay open later on summer weeknights after they get settled in to the new routine.</p><p>I Dream of Weenie has been sorely missed by its East Nashville community (and those of us across the river who make the trek for it), and we&#x2019;re pretty excited for its triumphant return.</p><p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
