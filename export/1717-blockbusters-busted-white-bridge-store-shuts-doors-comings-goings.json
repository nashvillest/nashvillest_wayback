Yippee, liquidation sales! But we have to wonder&#x2026;</p>\n<p>Is this forewarning of what&#x2019;s to come? Blockbuster is <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/19109917/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">struggling to complete financing deals</a> and to stay afloat amidst competitors Netflix and Redbox, and <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2344572,00.asp?kc=PCRSS03069TX1K0001121\" target=\"_blank\">recent reports don&#x2019;t do much to convince us</a> of their long-term sustainability.

Uh, not that we did that or anything.</p>\n<p>Really, we&#x2019;re just glad that at least most Blockbuster employees get to keep their jobs. A shuttering of 7,400 stores wouldn&#x2019;t do anything for our already astronomical unemployment rate.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucias_clay/1555313896/\" target=\"_blank\">lucias_clay</a>. </em></p>"
