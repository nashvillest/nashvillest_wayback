The only problem with Vandy&#x2019;s lineup announcements is that they&#x2019;re really, really, <em>really</em> bad at keeping them under wraps. Last year, their student site&#xA0;InsideVandy leaked the info early, and with that in mind, we weren&#x2019;t shocked when a full week before performers were supposed to be announced, the <a href=\"http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/16466\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.insidevandy.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Rites of Spring site started showing this year&#x2019;s lineup a few days ago</a>.</p><p>&#x2026;Or was it? They quickly changed the performers on the site, claiming it was just a test, but that didn&#x2019;t stop organizers from hustling out an official announcement a few days ahead of schedule (and at midnight. Seriously guys, bloggers gotta sleep sometime). And what do you know! It looks like that &#x201C;test site&#x201D; was not so much of a test.&#xA0;<strong>Kid Cudi</strong>, <strong>The National</strong>, <strong>Public Enemy</strong> and <strong>Sara Bareilles</strong> will top the Rites of Spring 2011 bill, joined by&#xA0;<strong>Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros</strong> and <strong>Matt &amp; Kim</strong>.
