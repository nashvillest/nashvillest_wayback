Here we are almost 24 hours from kickoff and Our Favorite Titan Ever Steve McNair is toying with our hearts. A few days ago, he was outed for agreeing to host a Ravens rally within spittin&#x2019; distance of LP Field on game day. Then he acted all shocked that it was a Raven&#x2019;s rally and said he only <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=65237\" target=\"_blank\">thought it was a fund raiser for the Ronald McDonald House IN BALTIMORE</a> and decided to gracefully bow out. Now he&#x2019;s changed his mind again and wants to do it, saying that it&#x2019;s not about the Titans or the Ravens, it&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9638317\" target=\"_blank\">FOR THE CHILDREN</a>. Sorry, Steve, we&#x2019;re not buying it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bellevue&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2009/1/8/target_likely_bellevue_tenant\" target=\"_blank\">swapping their Macy&#x2019;s for a Target</a>. We think that&#x2019;s probably a pretty good deal. Though we&#x2019;re still pretty appalled that the Hickory Hollow Macy&#x2019;s is staying.</li>\n<li>Opponents of English Only keep chipping away at the argument, this time saying that no, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18443664/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">English Only actually won&#x2019;t save the city any money</a>. Councilman Crafton says, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just meet at the ballot box and count votes.&#x201D;</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong><a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9642943\" target=\"_blank\">Erin Brokovich</a> is the latest force to get her hands dirty in the TVA ash spill &#x2026; A man says he was fired from the Brentwood Holiday Inn <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/18442419/detail.html?rss=nash&amp;psp=news\" target=\"_blank\">because he&#x2019;s gay</a> &#x2026; Be kind and don&#x2019;t dump your <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9643088\" target=\"_blank\">non-digital-switchover-ready TV</a> because it&#x2019;ll cost you.</li>\n</ul>"
