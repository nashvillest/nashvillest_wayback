Never the kind to be trifled with, Toby did what any self-respecting Okie-turned-Nashvillian would do and hopped off the stage, dropped a few f-bombs, challenged the fan to fight, and then had the guy carted out of the concert. But since Toby is a gentleman, Toby also apologized. Good thing someone videotaped it.

Or maybe he won&#x2019;t! Nobody knows.
