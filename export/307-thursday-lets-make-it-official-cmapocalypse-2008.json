So we&#x2019;ll spare you the details. Instead, we&#x2019;re opting for a rundown of the free and open to the public hotspots that are running all week, so if you have some free time on a lunch break or you&#x2019;re looking for a way to entertain the kids, we&#x2019;ve got you covered.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://cmafest.com/2008/entertainment/zone_fun/default.aspx\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/cmafest.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">FUNZONE</a>/HARD ROCK OUTDOOR STAGE<br></strong>In the parking lot of the Hard Rock Cafe lies a &#x201C;FunZone,&#x201D; apparently. It&#x2019;s technically open today from 9am-6pm, although the free concerts continue past 7pm (so we&#x2019;re not sure how that works). The schedule for today includes NASCAR driver Bobby Labonte signing (10am-12pm), concerts (11:15am-1:50pm; 6:30pm-7:15pm), and LOTS of free samples.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://cmafest.com/2008/entertainment/zone_family/default.aspx\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/cmafest.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">FAMILYZONE</a> by McDonalds/Dr. Pepper<br></strong>A short walk away from the FunZone on 5th &amp; Demonbreun lies the FamilyZone (very creative, CMA). Thursday is &#x201C;Safety Day&#x201D; at the FamilyZone. We&#x2019;re also not sure what the theme has to do with anything. A wide variety of shows and events will be going on all day, plus your standard facepainting, magicians, inflatable bouncy houses, free food, and more. Check out the <a href=\"http://cmafest.com/2008/entertainment/zone_family/default.aspx\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/cmafest.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> to plan a strategic day for the kids. Strawberry Shortcake is even performing each day. We thought we left her back in the 90&#x2019;s, but apparently she&#x2019;s staging a comeback.</p><p><strong>CHEVY </strong><strong>(You guessed it) </strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.cmafest.com/2008/entertainment/zone_sports/default.aspx\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.cmafest.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">SPORTSZONE</a><br></strong>Behind the Sommet Center, you&#x2019;ll find the Chevy SportsZone. It&#x2019;s open from 11am-5pm today, and once again will provide excessive free food &amp; drink samples. Between outdoorsman competitions, more NASCAR/Pro fishing autograph sessions, and multiple (and possibly also excessive) K9s In Flight demonstrations, the SportsZone has a lot happening in a short amount of time. We can&#x2019;t wait until Sunday&#x2019;s tractor race. No, seriously.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/blueshoe/174182280/in/photostream/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Erickson</a>. </em></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/06/friday-oh-were-halfway-there-cmapocalypse-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Friday: Oh, We&#x2019;re Halfway There (CMApocalypse 2008)\">Friday: Oh, We&#x2019;re Halfway There (CMApocalypse 2008)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/11/theyre-back-cmapocalypse-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: They&#x2019;re Back!
