According to county officials, the TVA never consulted them before developing the viewing area which is supposed to include a parking lot big enough for 20 cars. The TVA claims that they were only trying to promote transparency, but some folks would rather try to&#xA0; forget about it and not have the extra traffic from visitors gawking at the site.
