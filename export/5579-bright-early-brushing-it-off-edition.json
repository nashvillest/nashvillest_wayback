We had sort of a close call with that animal we call the Cumberland yesterday as waters seemed to approach flood stage for the first time since May. With all the rain earlier this week, some water was released from the Old Hickory Dam which caused the river to swell. Though it did serve as an important reminder that the Cumberland has been a jerk to us in the past and can definitely do it again, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=13013350\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">it ended up cresting around 34 feet&#x2013;a full six feet below flood stage</a>. Phew! Oh, and thanks to all the volunteers <em>and</em> inmates who spent the afternoon slinging sandbags to make sure we were safe.</p><ul><li><strong>What a quack. </strong>It was an exciting day for at least one duck boat yesterday when <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/24693581/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">the vehicle, carrying several Duck Tour passengers, lost steering on the river</a>. Passengers report that the captain simply drove them around in circles to avoid hitting the embankments until finally a passing barge nudged them ashore.
