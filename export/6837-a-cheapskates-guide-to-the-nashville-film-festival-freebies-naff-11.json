What&#x2019;s a broke film junkie to do? If you&#x2019;re okay with flying by the seat of your pants, you may find that you can experience the Nashville Film Festival at a very low cost (like free). Sounding better? We thought so.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Hit up the free films and panels.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah yeah yeah, thank you Captain Obvious, etc. But were you <em>really</em> going to comb through the hundreds of film listings to find out which ones are free and open to the public? No, that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re here. And we like to think that it&#x2019;s a little known fact that a handful of film screenings, events and panels throughout the fest are free. No tickets, no reservations, no money &#x2013; just get your butt in the seat before someone else does. Here are some of the freebies:</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><em><a href=\"http://prod1.agileticketing.net/WebSales/pages/EventDescription.aspx?EventID=34518&amp;ri=10180&amp;lf=10181&amp;lnkID=EventDataList_ctl00_ucEventItem_lbPurchaseEvent&amp;lnkTXT=Buy%20Tickets&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Screen Actors Guild, But Were Afraid to Ask</a>. <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Thursday, April 14, 2pm.<br>\n</span><a href=\"http://prod1.agileticketing.net/WebSales/pages/EventDescription.aspx?EventID=32423&amp;ri=10180&amp;lf=10181\" target=\"_blank\">Shorts for the Family</a></em>.

Is your ID card intact? If you meet these two criteria, you&#x2019;ll be able to get into any not sold out matinee film screening (weekdays before 5pm) for free. Easy. If you&#x2019;ve got some extra cash and a burning desire to see a popular movie, your student ID also gets you discounted tickets ($9, regular price is $12).</p>\n<p>Students at these schools can also &#x201C;rush&#x201D; panels at any time of the day, meaning you can fill in any unsold seats if you show up right before the panel begins.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Record Store Day!</strong></p>\n<p>The Nashville Film Festival is taking a little field trip to Record Store Day at Grimey&#x2019;s this year. The Basement will be screening three of the film fest&#x2019;s music films for free on Saturday, April 16.</p>\n<p>1:00 Broke*<br>\n2:00 Heavy Metal Picnic w/ Q&amp;A by the director<br>\n4:30 Better Than Something: Jay Reatard</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: NowPlayingNashville.</strong></p>\n<p>Straight up free tickets at <a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/page/NashvilleFilmFestival\" target=\"_blank\">NowPlayingNashville</a> for those sans college enrollment.&#xA0;New free tickets are added each day at 5pm, so bookmark <a href=\"http://www.nowplayingnashville.com/page/NashvilleFilmFestival\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a> and keep checking back to see what fate has planned for your evening.</p>\n<p>There! Don&#x2019;t you feel better already? If this bag of tricks isn&#x2019;t enough to sate your desire for free films this week, don&#x2019;t forget to check out the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/08/film-forward-at-the-belcourt-explore-other-cultures-with-free-films-panels/\" target=\"_blank\">Belcourt&#x2019;s Film Forward</a>.
