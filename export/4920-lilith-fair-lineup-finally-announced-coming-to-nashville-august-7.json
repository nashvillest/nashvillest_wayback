But! When the date was released (August 7 at Bridgestone Arena, in case you were wondering), we still had to wait for the lineup. And wait we did. And wait, and wait, and wait. And then it rained a bunch (remember that?), and we didn&#x2019;t even realize that the wait was over. The Nashville Lilith Fair lineup is here, and it includes:</p>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Sarah McLachlan</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Beth Orton</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Loretta Lynn</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Indigo Girls</div>\n<div>Lissie</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Butterfly Boucher</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Court Yard Houds</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Priscilla Renea</div>\n<p>And Janelle Monae, according to the <em>Scene</em>, but not according to the Lilith Fair website, which makes us sad, because we love her.</p>\n<p>Also performing will be the winner of the Lilith Fair Local Talent Search&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ourstage.com/go/lilith\" target=\"_blank\">OurStage competition</a>, which means exactly what you think it means. One aspiring lady-rocker (or group of lady-rockers) from the area will perform at each Lilith Fair date, so get to submitting.</p>\n<p>The local tie-in (which we love) is that $1 from every ticket sold will be donated to a local women&#x2019;s charity, and the charity is chosen by <a href=\"http://lilithfair.com/events/Nashville-TN/220/info\" target=\"_blank\">your vote</a>! Speaking of tickets, they go on sale next Saturday, May 22, and if ticket prices in other cities are any indication, they&#x2019;ll start in the $30-40 range.</p>"
