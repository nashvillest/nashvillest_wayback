It&#x2019;s perfect weather to sit outside, plus if you tweet about being at the symphony every night while everyone else is at Bonnaroo, all of your internet friends will think you&#x2019;re super classy! Win-win. We recommend bringing a chair or a blanket and a water bottle**, but do whatever moves you.</p>\n<p><strong>Nashville Symphony Community Concerts 2012</strong></p>\n<p>June 7 at 8 p.m.: East Park&#xA0;(Program: Celebrating the Film Music of John Williams)<br>\nJune 8 at 8 p.m.: Bicentennial Mall State Park&#xA0;(Program: Celebrating the Film Music of John Williams)<br>\nJune 10 at 7 p.m.: Crockett Park, Brentwood&#xA0;(Program: Celebrating the Film Music of John Williams)<br>\nJune 19 at 7:30 p.m.: Centennial Park&#xA0;(Program: Shakespeare at the Symphony)</p>\n<p>*<em>There are actually six community concerts this year, but two of them cost $5 and are far away and one of them has already happened, so four it is.</em></p>\n<p>**<em>Or you know, juice or soda or&#x2026; whatever.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sduck409/4750435445/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Drake</a>.&#xA0;</em></p>"
