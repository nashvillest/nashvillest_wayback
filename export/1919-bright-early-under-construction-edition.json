Last night, the Metro Council <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090610/NEWS0202/906100390/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">approved funding for upwards of $600 million in construction projects all around the city</a>. Within the next few years, we&#x2019;re looking at a shiny new &#x201C;adventure play park&#x201D; (we can&#x2019;t wait to see what that is) on the riverfront, a <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/12/bright-early-smaller-world-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">connector road between north Nashville and West End</a>, some more classrooms so our schools can ditch the trailers, a crime lab for the Metro PD, a new library branch in Goodlettsville, and some fixing-up of our storm water system. And that&#x2019;s just the beginning.</p><ul><li><strong>Healthy kids. </strong>With school being out for the summer, Metro Action Commission is trying to make sure low-income kids still get a good meal during the day by <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090610/NEWS04/906100387/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">preparing and delivering 6,000 healthy lunches a day</a>. In Metro schools, 73% of the kids qualify for the free and reduced lunch program for low-income families.</li><li><strong>Happy things.</strong> Speaking of schools, congrats to Hume-Fogg and Martin Luther King Jr. magnet high schools who were <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/19705300/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">the only two schools in the state to make Newsweek&#x2019;s list of the top 100 schools</a> in the country.
