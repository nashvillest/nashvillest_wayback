Hey, we&#x2019;ll take pretty much anything if it&#x2019;s free! Following a very enjoyable Free Float Day at Sonic, A&amp;W will be holding a Free Float Day of their own, doling out <a href=\"http://www.awrestaurants.com\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.awrestaurants.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">free small root beer floats</a> tomorrow from 2pm-8pm only. We went to the Cool Springs location <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/mo-freebies-aw-root-beer-floats/\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>&#xA0;for our free floats, and you can count on finding us there again this year.&#xA0;</p><p>Additionally, A&amp;W is attempting to lure in the Father&#x2019;s Day crowd by offering $0.90 Papa Burgers on Sunday, so if you want to treat dad to a swanky meal, you know where to go!&#xA0;</p><p>A&amp;W has <a href=\"http://www.awrestaurants.com/storelocator/Default.aspx?address=37215\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.awrestaurants.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">locations</a> in <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Cool Springs</span>&#xA0;Madison, Smyrna, Murfreesboro and White House. EDIT: The Cool Springs location has apparently closed. We&#x2019;re bummed, and we apologize to anyone who tried to go out there!</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/03/tonight-free-root-beer-float-night-at-sonic-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tonight: Free Root Beer Float Night At Sonic [Freebies]\">Tonight: Free Root Beer Float Night At Sonic [Freebies]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/mo-freebies-aw-root-beer-floats/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Mo&#x2019; Freebies: A&amp;W Root Beer Floats\">Mo&#x2019; Freebies: A&amp;W Root Beer Floats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/30/tomorrow-free-back-yard-burgers-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Tomorrow: Free Back Yard Burgers To Earlybirds [Freebies]\">Tomorrow: Free Back Yard Burgers To Earlybirds [Freebies]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/03/22/free-cone-day-at-ben-jerrys-tomorrow-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Free Cone Day At Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Tomorrow [Freebies]\">Free Cone Day At Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Tomorrow [Freebies]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/02/19/national-holidays-we-like-free-pancake-free-pretzel-day-freebies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: National Holidays We Like: Free Pancake &amp; Free Pretzel Day [Freebies]\">National Holidays We Like: Free Pancake &amp; Free Pretzel Day [Freebies]</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
