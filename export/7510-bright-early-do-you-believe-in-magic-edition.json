The Nashville International Airport has been undergoing some extensive&#xA0;renovations recently&#xA0;&#xA0;which have resulted in some awfully confusing Monday mornings trying to pick our way around construction and figure out which yellow brick road will lead us to the sacred Economy Lot. But since the feds didn&#x2019;t exactly pass the new FAA budget (or any other budget, really) with flying colors, several of these projects could be&#xA0;halted&#xA0;now that funding is in jeopardy. Fortunately the largest construction project at BNA is a fancy new rental car facility for which the government isn&#x2019;t even paying. BNA officials are still trying to figure out exactly which projects will be affected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lethal injection drugs confiscated. </strong><a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=29072\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee and several other states have had some of their lethal injection drugs seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration after improperly importing the sedative from overseas</a>. The only US manufacturer stopped making the drug, so several states took it upon themselves to look for it elsewhere.</li>\n<li><strong>The cat got your ____? </strong>Every so often in Nashville, a driver blames an unsuspecting cat for some sort of destructive car accident, and this is one of those occasions. This one happened in the wee hours of Monday morning, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/15140555/cat-causes-rollover-crash-in-front-yard-of-home\" target=\"_blank\">when the driver claims he simply swerved to miss the cat sauntering across the street, causing his vehicle to flip over onto someone&#x2019;s front steps</a>. Both the cat and the human were unhurt.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>You are so Nashville if&#xA0;<a href=\"http://devour.com/video/awesome-nascar-prayer/\" target=\"_blank\">you publicly thank God for Goodyear Tires and your smokin&#x2019; hot wife at the NASCAR track</a> &#x2026; Not everyone is on board with <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/15144452/some-council-members-balk-at-call-for-arriola-resignation\" target=\"_blank\">the call for County Clerk John Arriola&#x2019;s resignation</a> &#x2026; A 19-year old Belmont student <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/15142186/belmont-student-pleads-guilty-to-making-bomb-threat\" target=\"_blank\">pleaded guilty to making a bomb threat back in May</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/15143649/munchak-titans-eager-to-get-back-to-work\" target=\"_blank\">The Titans are <em>so</em> over this lockout nonsense</a> &#x2026; The TVA&#x2019;s coal ash plant in Gallatin is <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/15144390/coal-ash-contaminating-groundwater-at-gallatin-plant\" target=\"_blank\">officially contaminating the groundwater</a> &#x2026; So we didn&#x2019;t get a whole lot of rain out of this front, <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/07/front-is-disappointment-for-rain-now-the-heat-returns/\" target=\"_blank\">but we did get some more boiling hot temperatures</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciana13/5971871766/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\">pink_fish13</a></em>.</p>"
