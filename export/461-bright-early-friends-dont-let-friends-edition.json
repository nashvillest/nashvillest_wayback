We hope you enjoyed the weekend cool-down as much as we did, even if you happened to miss the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/19/urban-pranksters-dive-in-theater/\" target=\"_blank\">June Freeze</a>. It was a rough weekend for the DUI&#x2019;s, though, as both Sounds&#x2019; outfielder <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8536747\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Laynce Nix</a> and Titans&#x2019; defensive end <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=8537075\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Jevon &#x201C;The Freak&#x201D; Kearse</a> were arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. We&#x2019;re guessing no one told them about <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/16/nashvillest-spotlight-zingo-nashville/\" target=\"_blank\">Zingo</a>. Either way, our hats are off to Metro for doing their best to keep our streets safe.</p><ul><li><strong>Rallying together.</strong> Residents of the quiet Hermitage subdivision Providence are <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080623/NEWS01/806230345/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">coming together</a> to fight against a proposed ministry and housing complex for men being released from prison. The complex would house 40 ex-cons about 10 miles away from the subdivision, and the residents are citing safety and property values as their main concerns.</li><li><strong>We&#x2019;ve got high hopes.</strong> Mayor Dean has thrown together a new committee that hopes to come up with ways to make Nashville the <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=60988\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">greenest city</a> in the Southeast, and maybe someday the US, even though we&#x2019;re usually rolling in behind Huntsville and Charlotte. It&#x2019;s a tall order, but we&#x2019;re hoping for the best. The efforts would place a lot of focus on cleaning up the water systems and the Cumberland since more than 16 million tons of sewage are dumped into it every year.
