When we posted <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/23/our-citys-best-as-told-by-aol/\" target=\"_blank\">AOL&#x2019;s City&#x2019;s Best</a> list last week, the feedback suggested two things; First, that we should all try to convince the tourists that the &#x201C;local slang&#x201D; for the Pancake Pantry is &#x201C;PanPan,&#x201D; and second, that no list of bests will ever please everyone.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The Tennessean has totaled the votes in their own version of City&#x2019;s Best, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/23/our-citys-best-as-told-by-aol/\" target=\"_blank\">The Toast of Music City</a>. Shame on Nashvillians for voting three national chains into the top 3 Italian spots, and double shame for Olive Garden actually being one of them. There&#x2019;s a lot of the same boring chains scoring top spots (Baskin Robbins &amp; Maggie Moos for best ice cream?) with no mention of some of the best local spots &#x2013; <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/piedpipercreamery\" target=\"_blank\">Pied Piper Creamery</a>, anyone? In this sense, AOL actually did a better job at uncovering some of our local gems. The Toast of Music City is good for a hearty laugh, though. Our favorites are:</p>\n<p>Shoney&#x2019;s &#x2013; 3rd Best Breakfast &amp; 2nd Best Meal Deal<br>\nGolden Corral &#x2013; 2nd Best Buffet<br>\nLoose Leaf Tea Bar &#x2013; 2nd Best Bar<br>\nPF Chang&#x2019;s &#x2013; 1st Best Chinese &amp; 2nd Best Asian</p>\n<p>We promise never to do this again, but we&#x2019;ve just got to say it: LOL. &#xA0;</p>"
