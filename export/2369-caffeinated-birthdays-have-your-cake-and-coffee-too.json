Two of our favorite new coffee shops are celebrating their first birthdays this week. We can hardly believe that it&#x2019;s been a year since <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/25/nashville-newcomers-drinkhaus-espresso-tea/\" target=\"_blank\">DrinkHaus&#x2019; mango blood orange gelato</a> passed our lips for the first time, and since we <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/19/east-nashville-invasion-fresh-blends-ugly-mugs/\" target=\"_blank\">parked our butts at Ugly Mugs</a> on what was the first of dozens of trips to come. But time flies when you&#x2019;re having fun!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://uglymugsnashville.com/html_ver/\" target=\"_blank\">Ugly Mugs</a> is celebrating their first birthday with a good, old-fashioned birthday party tonight from 6pm-close. Music is from 6pm-9pm, featuring an assortment of Ugly Mugs patrons and baristas (Tyrus Morgan, Dewveall, Drew Holcomb and Dave Coleman). Expect birthday cake, prizes, a &#x201C;chamfake&#x201D; toast and a healthy dose of celebration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://drinkhaus.blogspot.com/2009/08/1-year-anniversary.html\" target=\"_blank\">DrinkHaus</a> is celebrating their first birthday by giving Nashville the gifts&#x2026; any size iced coffee will be just $1 all day this coming Monday, August 10. They plan to party later this month.</p>\n<p>Swing by either establishment, drop some dollars and hum a little happy birthday tune if you appreciate them as much as we do. Happy birthday!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/termie/3718525589/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>termie</em></a><em>. </em></p>"
