They estimate that putting ads on just 30-40% of the school buses could translate into a half-million dollars. [<a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/24857732/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">WSMV</a>]</li>\n<li>Tennessee could be joining a consortium with 10 other states to develop a new computerized system for standardized testing. No more Scantron! But more significantly, those states would all be learning, testing and being evaluated on the same material.

Basically, Omni will front the $225 million for the project and Metro will slowly pay them back $103 million out of tourism taxes over the next 20 years. They&#x2019;ll also be getting some tax incentives. Sadly, we have to wait a whole month to see what it&#x2019;s going to look like.

Also in the building were countless lawn mowers, bikes and generators that were likely stolen.

Well, we at least know that there&#x2019;s 750 miles of sidewalk and 1,000 miles of bike lanes in it for us.
