Ride leaders will depart from a few different meeting places around town between 6:15 and 7:15am and arrive at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center around 7:30am. City leaders, including Mayor Dean, will be there taking advantage of the free food and giving you tips on how to green your commute. No registration required, but helmets are a must.
