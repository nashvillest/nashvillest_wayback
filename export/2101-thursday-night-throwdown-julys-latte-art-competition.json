Registration begins at 7pm and the competition starts at 8pm [<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_m1pdgF-6rpc/SlJaH32SeWI/AAAAAAAABAE/-8lSExjtI3A/s1600-h/TNT.July.Poster.gif\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;a/2.bp.blogspot.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">more info</a>].</p>\n<p>Needing an extra nudge out the door?
