They&#x2019;ll have all seven of the Music City Star cars running tonight, with busses on standby just in case. There will be a special 9:30pm trip out of Nashville to accommodate parade-goers, so if you&#x2019;re out that way and don&#x2019;t want to battle the traffic and parking, grab a ticket and join us! Tickets are $5 one way or $10 round trip.&#xA0;</p><p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/zanzibar123/2351605053/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>zanzibar</em></a><em>.&#xA0;</em></p>"}
