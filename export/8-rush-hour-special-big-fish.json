Hopefully you weren&#x2019;t blown away like our neighbors in Spring Hill. Channel 4 is reporting that a tornado took out a gas station near Hwy. 31 this morning. No injuries were reported.

We&#x2019;re happy to hear someone&#x2019;s benefiting from the high gas prices.

The suspect was believed to be the same man who came into the business asking for a job earlier this morning and is still on the run.

After lugging the beast into Kroger to verify the weight, he released it back into the lake and declared that they only taste good if they&#x2019;re between 2 and 8 pounds. Some stories actually do have happy endings. Also, there are pictures.

Country Music Hall of Famer Eddy Arnold, 89, passed away at a Williamson County nursing home this morning. He was a little before our time, but we hear he paved the way for some of the newer country we actually like. We&#x2019;ll drink to that.
