If you&#x2019;re dying to throw yourself into the Black Friday fray, you&#x2019;ll be happy to know that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081118/COUNTY0102/81118064/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">the folks at Opry Mills have you covered.</a> Starting tomorrow night at midnight, most of the 200 stores will be opening their doors (except Bass Pro because they&#x2019;re lame) to everyone who&#x2019;s crazy enough to be at the mall in the middle of the night. The festivities will carry on through the early morning hours and well into the next day:</p>\n<p><em><strong>[Updated 11/27, 8pm]</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong> 1 &#x2013; 6 a.m.</strong> &#x2014; Shoppers can rest their feet to enjoy Classic Holiday Movies on the big screen and free popcorn in the Food Court.</p>\n<p><strong> 2 a.m.</strong> &#x2014; The first 300 shoppers ages 18 and older who arrive at the Regal Cinemas Court after the midnight opening will get a wristband that allows participation in Opry Mills&#x2019; sixth annual Balloon Pop at 2 a.m. All balloons will be attached to columns to be popped and will contain vouchers for Simon Giftcards, including a grand prize of $1,000!</p>\n<p><strong> 6 &#x2013; 7 a.m.</strong> &#x2014; After working up an appetite, shoppers are invited at 6 a.m. to have Breakfast with Dancers from the World Famous Rockettes. Guests will be treated to free coffee and doughnuts, candid photos with the Rockettes and the chance to play in a 100-person game of Musical Chairs for a $500 Simon Giftcard!</p>\n<p><strong> 4 &#x2013; 6 p.m.</strong> &#x2014; Black Friday also will feature the debut of &#x201C;Holiday Family Theater,&#x201D; a 30-minute family musical featuring holiday songs and carols, a reading of &#x201C;The Night Before Christmas&#x201D; and an appearance by Santa Claus in a magical finale.
