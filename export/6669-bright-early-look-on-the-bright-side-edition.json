But we digress. We&#x2019;re coming up on the one-year anniversary of the Nashville Flood and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110310/NEWS01/103100345/2275/rss05\" target=\"_blank\">Mayor Dean&#x2019;s flood team is getting ready to study some options for keeping our city safer during (heaven forbid!) another similar disaster</a>.
