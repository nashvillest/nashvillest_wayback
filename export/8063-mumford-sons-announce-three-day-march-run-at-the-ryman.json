Okay, they definitely love us. If you didn&#x2019;t get a chance to catch Mumford &amp; Sons at their sold-out War Memorial show in November 2010, they&#x2019;re coming back for another round (or three). <a href=\"http://www.mumfordandsons.com/news/ryman-auditorium-nashville-shows-announced\" target=\"_blank\">The band announced today that they&#x2019;ll be playing three consecutive Nashville shows in March</a>, at none other than our beloved Mother Church. Tickets go on sale February 4th. If you&#x2019;ll excuse us, we&#x2019;re off to go stand in line now.</p><p><strong>Mumford &amp; Sons at the Ryman Auditorium, March 6, 7 &amp; 8</strong>.<br><em>Tickets on sale February 4 at Ticketmaster. </em></p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/scribebytrade/5138495383/\" target=\"_blank\">christyfrink</a>. </em></p>"}
