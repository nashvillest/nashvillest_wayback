A quick Google search revealed that Flight of the Conchords are indeed scheduled to hit the Ryman on April 10. It hasn&#x2019;t even been added to The Ryman&#x2019;s site yet, but there it is in all its shining glory on <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1B00423CAB3C430F?artistid=1124925&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Ticketmaster.com</a>. We may have even felt a tiny twinge of affection for Ticketmaster just now. </span></p>\n<p>Presale begins this coming Monday at 10am, and then begins the long 2-month wait until the show. We&#x2019;ll try not to spontaneously combust in the meantime.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 1:49PM: </strong>We&#x2019;ve found the presale password, and since we don&#x2019;t want to be spoilsports, just go add <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Flight-of-the-Conchords/7585969235?ref=s\" target=\"_blank\">Flight of the Conchords</a> on Facebook and then view their recent updates. You&#x2019;ll find it there. Enjoy!</p>"
