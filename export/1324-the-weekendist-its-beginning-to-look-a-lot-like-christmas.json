Nearly every event is Christmas themed, and the big Nashville Christmas parade is even this weekend. A little early, if you ask us (they didn&#x2019;t), but maybe all this sleet and freezing rain has got the city tricked into thinking that Christmas is already here. Hopefully there will be a little less ice and a little more sun this weekend for the festivities. Meanwhile, we just hung the Christmas Countdown Chalkboard at the Nashvillest HQ, and we&#x2019;re plotting out what to do in the 21 days until it&#x2019;s <em>actually</em>&#xA0;Christmas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>FRIDAY&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.coolpeoplecare.org/event/2008/12/05/cummins-station-artisan-fair/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.coolpeoplecare.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Cummins Station Artisan Fair</a></strong>, 11am-3pm: The first three Fridays in December, Cummins Station will be hosting an artisan fair, a gathering of handmade crafts, artwork, food and more.

American Idol finalist Phil Stacey will be gracing us with his presence at the tree lighting ceremony, as will a quartet from the Barbership Harmony Society.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.piedmontng.com/itc/communityOutreach/nashvilleChristmasParade\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.piedmontng.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nashville (Gas) Christmas Parade</strong></a>, 7pm: Nashville&#x2019;s annual Christmas parade, sponsored by Piedmont Natural Gas, is this weekend. As we mentioned, it seems unusually early for a Christmas parade &#x2013; Are they always this early in December? Anyway, the parade is a good time to fight for parking downtown and stand outside in the freezing cold for an hour. Christmas spirit! Should you need to call the Parade Information Line for some reason, you may do so by dialing&#xA0;(615) 734-1708.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvillezoo.org/events_detail.asp?eventID=54\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.nashvillezoo.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">A Croft House Christmas At The Nashville Zoo</a></strong>, 10am-3pm: Beginning this weekend, get into the holiday spirit at the Nashville Zoo!
