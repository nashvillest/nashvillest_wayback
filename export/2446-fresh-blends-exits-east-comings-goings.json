Owner Tony Reall hopes to return to the East Nashville market in the near future, but operating the two stores simultaneously proved to be too large of an undertaking. Exciting plans are in the works for the Belmont store, with more relaxed seating, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/freshblends\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> specials, and fun community events coming soon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">East Nashville, say your goodbyes&#x2026; And cross the river once in a while! We think that Fresh Blends is worth it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephenyeargin/3298723349/\" target=\"_blank\">stephenyeargin</a>.</p>"
