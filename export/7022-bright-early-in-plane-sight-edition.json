The death toll for this week&#x2019;s storms has grown to at least 290 across six states, including 206 in Alabama alone, and many people are still missing. The National Weather Service is still trying to determine how to classify the Tuscaloosa tornado, but they say it was at least an EF4, if not an EF5. <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14534933/alabama-residents-flock-to-tenn-for-gas-supplies\" target=\"_blank\">Residents are pouring across the Tennessee border into Maury County to find gas and other supplies</a>. Here in Tennessee, there have been 33 fatalities counted so far, mainly in the southeast part of the state, and <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/04/nws-confirms-tornadoes-in-rutherford-and-lawrence-counties/\" target=\"_blank\">the National Weather Service also confirmed that tornadoes touched down in nearby Rutherford and Lawrence counties</a>. <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=26430\" target=\"_blank\">The Nashville chapter of the Red Cross is starting to deploy volunteers all across the state and into other parts of the south</a> for disaster relief work.

And since the only noteworthy musical thing the Canadians have given us recently is Justin Bieber, we would like to do whatever we can to keep that from happening.
