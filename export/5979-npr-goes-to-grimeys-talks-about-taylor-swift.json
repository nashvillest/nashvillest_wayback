If that confuses you, you probably weren&#x2019;t one of the four people who went to Grimey&#x2019;s to purchase T-Sweezy&#x2019;s new album&#xA0;<em>Speak Now </em>on&#xA0;release day.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>So we know that somewhere out there, people are paying for country records. Turns out they&#x2019;re even doing so in Nashville. Davis says that at Grimey&#x2019;s, a decade-old indie-focused store just around the corner from Music Row near downtown Nashville, he&#x2019;s seen an uptick in customer interest for mainstream country releases.</em></p>\n<p><em>&#x201C;I sold a grand total of one of that last Taylor Swift CD,&#x201D; Davis says, speaking of Fearless, the best-selling album of 2009. He says that in its first day on sale last week, Grimey&#x2019;s customers picked up four copies of Speak Now.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Check out the full article at the link below.</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">NPR</span></strong>:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/11/02/130998948/at-a-nashville-record-store-mainstream-country-fights-for-shelf-space\">At A Nashville Record Store, Mainstream Country Fights For Shelf Space</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kelstew/2360015107/\" target=\"_blank\">kelstew</a>.</em></p>"
