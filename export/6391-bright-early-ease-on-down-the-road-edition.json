After a long, long, long Metro Council meeting last night, they decided to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13866392\" target=\"_blank\">pass the amended fairgrounds bill that will spare the racetrack and fairgrounds from demolition at least through 2012</a>. More than 1,000 folks turned out for the meeting and hundreds of Nashvillians (and lots of non-Nashvillians, oddly enough) spoke on both sides of the issue. In addition to the fairgrounds vote, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/nondiscrimination-bill-survives-unusual-first-reading-vote\" target=\"_blank\">the non-discrimination ordinance requiring all of Metro&#x2019;s contractors to have non-discrimination policies in place passed its first reading</a>.
