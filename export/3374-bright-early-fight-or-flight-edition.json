An closer look at the financing plan for the proposed Music City Center has revealed that <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091206/NEWS0202/912060348/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">the current proposal would divert close to $14 million in subsidies way from other tourist attractions including the Adventure Science Center, the Preds, the Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Farmer&#x2019;s Market</a>. Mayor Dean made the promise a long time ago that property taxes would not be used for the venture, but the funding source would instead rely on hotel/motel taxes and other taxes that target out-of-towners. Unfortunately $14 million of these tax dollars are already being used elsewhere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting healthy.</strong> Tennessee has <a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/23d51ef5-www.fox17.com.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">jumped several slots on the United Health Foundation&#x2019;s ranking of the healthiest states to live in, moving from 48th to 44th place</a>. So although we&#x2019;re still pretty close to the bottom of the list (thank goodness for Misssissippi), we&#x2019;re not <em>as</em> unhealthy as we used to be.</li>\n<li><strong>More shadiness from Sommet. </strong>In the flurry of finger-pointing over the last few weeks regarding the Preds&#x2019; ruptured relations with the Sommet Group, the Sommet CEO accused Preds owner David Freeman of having a $3.3 million federal tax lien. Turns out the <a href=\"http://www.ontheforecheck.com/2009/12/4/1185711/nashville-predators-arena-sponsor\" target=\"_blank\">Sommet group has a $330,000 lien themselves along with an expired business license</a> that should&#x2019;ve prevented their temporary staffing arm from doing business since the end of July.
