Lest we start thinking that our 10.5% unemployment rate comes without a price, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11543443\" target=\"_blank\">Governor Phil told state lawmakers yesterday that another hike in unemployment tax is just around the corner</a>. The first increase was enacted earlier this year to help ensure that the state&#x2019;s unemployment fund wouldn&#x2019;t run dry and unemployed Tennesseans wouldn&#x2019;t be left without that safety net. Now it&#x2019;s looking like that wasn&#x2019;t quite enough. Hopefully the second time&#x2019;s the charm.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gangs on the rise. </strong>Gang violence is getting a little ridiculous in some Metro Schools, including Glencliff High where <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/21668234/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">members of the Brown Pride and Sur-13 gangs have reportedly been beating each other silly at least twice a week</a>. MNPS personnel are meeting with Metro Police to figure out how to handle the problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Happy belated World Toilet Day.</strong> We&#x2019;re sort of upset that we didn&#x2019;t realize yesterday was World Toilet Day as declared by the World Toilet Organization. Fortunately the holiday was not overlooked by Vandy, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=11540475\" target=\"_blank\">who used the day to remind everyone just how much water with their fancy waterless urinals and dual-flush toilets</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11543067\" target=\"_blank\">John Rich is back in court</a> for that one time he allegedly assaulted and harassed <em>Nashville Star</em> contestant Jared Ashley &#x2026; Hooray for the <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/preds-win-devil-shootout\" target=\"_blank\">Preds winning again</a>! &#x2026; Gibson&#x2019;s CEO is <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091119/BUSINESS01/911190358/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">taking a leave of absence from the board of the Rainforest Alliance</a> because of that whole federal raid thing &#x2026; After having a really wet September and October, we&#x2019;re in the midst of the <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2009/11/20/just-a-little-rain-sunday/\" target=\"_blank\">driest November in recorded history</a>.</li>\n</ul>"
