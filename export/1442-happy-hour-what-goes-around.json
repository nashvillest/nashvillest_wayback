Jason Mumpower lost the Speaker of the House vote that everyone thought he had in the bag. And mostly because <a href=\"http://www.terrilynnweaver.com/\" target=\"_blank\">some n00b</a> pressed the wrong button.

Which almost makes it more interesting that he can&#x2019;t find time to debate David Briley on NPT.

Jim Cooper led a 2-mile walk to the early voting site from the Metro Courthouse this morning to vote against the English Only charter amendment.

Both of them are in the hospital and no one seems to know why it happened.
