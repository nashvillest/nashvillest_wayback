Upon further inspection, it does appear that the same person had a hand in at least two, if not all of them. Good thing that it doesn&#x2019;t make them any less funny.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"http://nashville.craigslist.org/m4w/747948025.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashville.craigslist.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Who wants to attend the Hog Fest on my 4HP mini bike this weekend?</a></h3>\n<p>OK the Hog Fest is coming up this weekend, YES its this weekend already! I am so excited. I have detailed out my mini bike and just put me a new bell on the handlebars. Let me tell ya she is looking really sharp! I know its not a Harley but hey different is good plus its not really that fast so you will be safe with me. The problem is I only have one helmet which we can share on the way if you dont mind it has an adjustable chin strap so It will fit unless you have a head as big as Rosie Odonell.<br>\nI am not really attractive and I have a few bad habits that tend to make people feel un easy around me, but hey whos perfect. If color is an issue of my mini bike let me know I can run down to the dollar general store and pick up a can of your color choice.<br>\nHey shoot me an email if you also have a mini bike I would love to hear from you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We told you it was classy. And here, on the opposite side of the spectrum, we bring you a post from someone who is looking for the person that they already went out with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"http://nashville.craigslist.org/m4w/747946361.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashville.craigslist.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Has anyone seen my big boy pants? &#x2013; 35 (Nashville)</a></h3>\n<p>OK, I cant remember who you are. We went out on a date last night to McDonalds you had a salad with chicken nuts and I shared since I forgot my wallet. After that we went to Mapco to get a hot dog and a slurpee shared of course cause I couldnt find my wallet, it was just really an excuse to see if you would come into my apartment to look for my wallet.<br>\nWe drove to the dam at Preist and talked for hours all of a sudden I felt the hershey squirts coming on so I made a run out of your car for the woods.<br>\nWell to make a long story short when I got home this morning I didnt have my big boy pants and wonder if this is you who went out with me last night?<br>\nHave you seen my Big Boy Pants?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Think their date will be responding?</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/14/gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist-reform-school/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Reform School\">Gems From The Nashville Craigslist: Reform School</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/18/now-thats-a-car-salesman-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Now That&#x2019;s A Car Salesman [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Now That&#x2019;s A Car Salesman [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/29/that-just-might-work-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: That Just Might Work [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">That Just Might Work [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/02/dirty-business-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Dirty Business [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">Dirty Business [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/10/22/the-best-missed-connections-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Best Missed Connections [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]\">The Best Missed Connections [Gems From The Nashville Craigslist]</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
