Maybe we were expecting a bit more excitement, but it seemed a little on the small side. The masses of hula-hooping children were the entertainment for the afternoon, with a collection of tents and vendors in a small circle next to the <a href=\"http://www.theturniptruck.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.theturniptruck.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Turnip Truck</a>. Produce is limited this early in the season, so it was mostly greens, asparagus, and strawberries. One thing we noticed is that the East Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market will be selling local dairy and meat, something that sets it apart from other similar community markets. Prices were average, a pint of strawberries about $5 and a pound of asparagus about $6. We plan on returning during the summer to see what different crops turn up.</p><p>All in all, the East Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market is a great community gathering spot, but will only be able to supplement your weekly produce needs.</p><p>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/an0nym0usmuse/209570623/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">an0nym0usmuse</a>.</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/06/13/nashville-farmers-market-more-than-veggies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market: More Than Veggies\">Nashville Farmer&#x2019;s Market: More Than Veggies</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/05/11/nashvilles-farmers-markets-local-food-movement-continues-to-grow/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville&#x2019;s Farmer&#x2019;s Markets: Local Food Movement Continues To Grow\">Nashville&#x2019;s Farmer&#x2019;s Markets: Local Food Movement Continues To Grow</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/05/18/weekend-field-trip-nashville-rollergirls-southern-hospital-ity/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Weekend Field Trip: Nashville Rollergirls&#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Southern Hospital-ity&lt;/i&gt;\">Weekend Field Trip: Nashville Rollergirls&#x2019; <i>Southern Hospital-ity</i></a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/05/how-now-the-wild-cow-veggie-eats-return-to-east-nashville-newcomers/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: How Now, The Wild Cow?
