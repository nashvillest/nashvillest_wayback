Tonight we&#x2019;ll have a chance to find out. Some of Nashville&#x2019;s photographers are gathering to do a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/nashville/discuss/72157605690948843/\" target=\"_blank\">summer photowalk</a> &#x2013; not only a great excuse to get out and get snapping, but a good opportunity to match a face to those Flickr photos.</p>\n<p>Organizing the photowalk is our loyal reader, commenter, and photo contributor <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/crashmattb/\" target=\"_blank\">crashmattb</a>. Meet up between 7pm-7:30pm TONIGHT at the parking lot between LP Field and the Shelby Street Bridge, and be sure to bring your cameras.
