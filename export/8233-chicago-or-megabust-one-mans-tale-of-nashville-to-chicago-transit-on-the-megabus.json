Because Megabus is relatively new to the Nashville area, we thought a lot of people might be interested in hearing how Ben&#x2019;s trip goes. So here are the facts: Ben purchased his ticket back in mid-March for $18.50, taxes included ($13 to Chicago, $5 back to Nashville). His bus departs at noon today and is expected to arrive in Chicago around 9:15pm.
