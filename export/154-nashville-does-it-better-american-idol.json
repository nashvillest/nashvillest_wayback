In the past, Nashville has had great representation on the show, producing the likes of <a href=\"http://www.aolcdn.com/ch_kids/kimberly-locke-400-011107.jpg\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.aolcdn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Kimberly Locke</a>, <a href=\"http://www.christianwomenonline.net/Mandisa_Image.jpg\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.christianwomenonline.net&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Mandisa</a>, and <a href=\"http://forum.belmont.edu/umac/archives/007115.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;forum.belmont.edu&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Melinda Doolittle</a>. And if they didn&#x2019;t live here before the show, many of the winners have since set up camp in Nashville after <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/2562715240063969586srtccu_ph.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">getting record deals</a> or simply out of some masochistic desire to join the ranks of up-and-coming musicians wearing out the karaoke circuit around town.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re happy to tell you that we can claim a piece of this season&#x2019;s pie, too. Even though Cook&#x2019;s performance of the song &#x201C;Time of My Life&#x201D; had us swooning last night, we had no idea it was <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080522/COLUMNIST0501/805220344\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">written by one of our own</a>, Nashville native Regie Hamm. The story is pretty heartwarming: Hamm&#x2019;s wife works at Starbucks while he stays home to take care of their daughter Isabella who has something called Angelman Syndrome (a disorder that causes severe developmental delays), and it&#x2019;s been a rough couple of years for them. Anyway, last night&#x2019;s <em>Idol </em>was the big break he needed to jump start his songwriting career. So thanks, Regie, for giving us something else to brag about.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/meagan383/2478736989/in/set-72157604971617654/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">meagan383</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/02/17/happy-hour-whos-your-american-idol/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Happy Hour: Who&#x2019;s Your American Idol?\">Happy Hour: Who&#x2019;s Your American Idol?</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
