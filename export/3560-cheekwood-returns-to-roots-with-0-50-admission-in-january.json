Thanks to everyone&#x2019;s&#xA0;favorite friend (inflation),&#xA0;regular admission is now up to $10 per person, but with plenty of generous free days to even things out.</p>\n<p>But before we get too nostalgic about the 60&#x2019;s, we&#x2019;ve got some good news to share &#x2013; Cheekwood is celebrating the beginning of their 50th year in Nashville by offering $0.50 admission for the month of January (see, we told you they were generous)! So try to forget about those below-freezing temperatures long enough for a frolic through the botanical gardens, or take the warmer approach and browse through the indoor art exhibitions while trying to remember, um, greener days. Either way, a visit to Cheekwood is a great way to spice up the dreary days of January, and for fifty cents it can&#x2019;t be beat.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mwoolfolk/2477230234/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>mahgegan?</em></a><em>. </em></p>"
