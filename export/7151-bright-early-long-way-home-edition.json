The attraction shut down last year after a particularly nasty battle with the MDHA in which the city bought up and demolished that entire section of town to make way for the new Music City convention center. Owner Joe Chambers hung on for as long as he could, insisting that he wasn&#x2019;t being offered fair compensation, but finally gave in and put his historic collection into storage. Several months later, the floodwaters crept into the storage facility and damaged much of the memorabilia including Johnny Cash&#x2019;s and Jimi Hendrix&#x2019;s guitars. <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110517/NEWS/305170055/Musicians-Hall-Fame-prepares-re-emerge-after-flood?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|FRONTPAGE|p\" target=\"_blank\">However, about 96% of the flood-damaged collection was able to be salvaged and may find a new home in the bottom floor of the Municipal Auditorium</a> if a deal is finalized.</p><ul><li><strong>Please oh please. </strong><a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14664186/tenn-senate-to-vote-on-high-alcohol-beer-proposal\" target=\"_blank\">The Senate is about to vote on a bill that would allow breweries (ahem, Yazoo) sell their high-alcohol beer (ahem, Sue) in the brewery</a> and would also allow distilleries (ahem, Jack Daniels) to sell their liquor in normal, non-commemorative bottles. Our fingers are crossed.</li><li><strong>Meanwhile in the &#x2018;boro. </strong>Murfreesboro residents are upset about yet another development right next door to the very controversial mosque site: A proposed site for alcohol and drug offenders.
