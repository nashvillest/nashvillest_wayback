It&#x2019;s going to be a short one this morning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#x2019;t count on too much snow tonight and tomorrow. At the moment, we&#x2019;re pretty much looking at a half-inch or less. [<a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2011/01/cloudy-today-some-spotty-moisture-highs-in-the-upper-40s/\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville WX</a>]</li>\n<li>And again, TDOT has been putting down brine ahead of the expected snow. Except they&#x2019;re running out of it so they&#x2019;ve started making their own with what little salt they have left. New salt shipments won&#x2019;t go out until February.

NES says that most people&#x2019;s bills were about 25% higher than average.

Conservative business leaders met on Wednesday to talk about ways to defeat a non-discrimination ordinance currently making its way through the Metro Council.

He says he&#x2019;s got his own routine back in Florida and he plans to stick with it because it apparently works.
