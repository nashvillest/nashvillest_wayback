State and federal agencies will team up with local ones to look at all aspects of flood preparedness from potential problem areas along the Cumberland River and its tributaries to the emergency management system. It could lead to some new floodwalls, levees, methods of water diversion and any other things that would help keep the damages to a minimum. Though the study comes with a hefty $500,000 price tag and the solutions could cost millions, the mayor feels that we&#x2019;re better off prepared.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nondiscrimination ordinance moves on</strong>.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=24198\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;wpln.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The proposed nondiscrimination ordinance passed its second reading at last night&#x2019;s Metro Council meeting</a>, meaning that it still has to go through a public hearing and pass a third reading before it becomes the real deal. It was amended to exclude businesses with fewer than 15 employees.</li>\n<li><strong>No more zero-tolerance? </strong><a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/education/26878344/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Metro Schools officials are reconsidering their zero-tolerance stance on bringing weapons and drugs to school</a>, which currently calls for the automatic suspension or expulsion of any offending student. Because they suspended almost 10,000 students last year, they want to figure out a way to get to the bottom of the situation without interrupting the students&#x2019; education if possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>Federal budget cuts may lead to <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=14029193\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">less money for flood victims and the arts</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/26869781/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">An ethics complaint has been filed against Metro Finance Director Rich Riebeling</a> claiming that he failed to disclose some aspects of his finances &#x2026; Polls show that <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/poll-reveals-bredesen-would-beat-corker-us-senate-race?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">former Governor Bredesen could beat Sen.
