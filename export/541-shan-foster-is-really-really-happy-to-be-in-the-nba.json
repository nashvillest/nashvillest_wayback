He&#x2019;s also a singer/songwriter. And he&#x2019;s really, really happy about being in the NBA &#x2013; so much so that he wrote a song about it (and posted it on YouTube for the world to see). It&#x2019;s sort of endearing, and we hope that the Mavs won&#x2019;t give him too much of a hard time for it. Sing it, Shan!</p><p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_XT4B8PyG6w&amp;hl=en\"><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/nk0aQg0p6Bw&amp;hl=en\"></object></p><p>No related posts.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
