The week of May 11-15 is Bike-To-Work Week. Friday, May 15 is Bike-To-Work Day, and In case it&#x2019;s not obvious, this week includes all three! Bike-To-Work Week encourages Nashvillians to hang up the car keys for a few days and hit the streets on bikes. If it&#x2019;s a feasible option for your commute, why not try? But beware: We&#x2019;ve heard reports that it can be addicting.</p><p>If one day sounds better than a whole week of biking, Bike-To-Work Day will be observed Friday, May 15. In the morning from 7:30am to 8:15am, cyclists will gather in front of the Schermerhorn Symphony Center for refreshments before taking off on their own. If you&#x2019;re a first-timer, this is a great chance to get your feet wet, as there will be six designated routes with ride leaders heading up the trek to the Schermerhorn. And one of our favorite morning before-work stops is giving away free drip coffee to all bikers&#x2026;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/CREMACREMA/status/1766076958\" target=\"_blank\">Thanks, CREMA</a>!</p><p>Bike-To-Work Week precedes Saturday&#x2019;s annual <a href=\"http://tourdenash.racesonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de Nash</a>, a leisurely turn-off-the-tv-and-computers-and-get-some-fresh-air event that can be done on foot or bicycle.
