As of 8am, NES reported that about 26,000 customers were without power and they&#x2019;re actively working to restore everyone as soon as possible. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/14703628/storms-continue-to-pound-tennessee\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.newschannel5.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The east side seemed to take the hardest hit with trees and powerlines down everywhere, crushing dozens of cars and at least one home</a>. Pea-sized hail was reported in East Nashville and Goodlettsville and weather experts still aren&#x2019;t ruling out the possibility of isolated tornadoes, but it&#x2019;ll take them a few days to assess the damage. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s not over yet as storm chances span out over the next two days. Stay safe out there, Nashville!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rough night for the Batman Building. </strong><a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/28001785/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">The Batman Building also nearly went up in flames last night when the power went out and a breaker tried to come back on, causing sparks to fly and ignite a small fire</a>. Thanks to the dozens of firefighters on the scene, the fire was quickly extinguished and no major damage was reported.</li>\n<li><strong>No CANDO. </strong><a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=27188\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;wpln.org&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Governor Haslam signed the law that prevents cities from imposing laws on private businesses, meaning that Nashville&#x2019;s recently-passed nondiscrimination ordinance is no longer valid</a>. &#xA0;The ordinance required all businesses that contract with Metro, religious organizations excluded, to have written nondiscrimination policies that cover sexual orientation and gender identity.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
