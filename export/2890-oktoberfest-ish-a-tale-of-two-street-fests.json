It&#x2019;s the day when two nearly-identical festivals, the Germantown Street Festival and Oktoberfest, take over parallel streets in the tiny neighborhood. To the casual observer, it would appear to be one big giant pile of German-themed festivity, and that&#x2019;s okay &#x2013; No matter which street you land on, you&#x2019;ll find plenty of treats, music, pony rides and frosty mugs of beir (<em>oh, the bier!</em>).</p><p>The <a href=\"http://historicgermantown.org/gsf.html\" target=\"_blank\">Germantown Street Festival</a> features a 5K Bier Run at 8am, a Pup Parade at 12:30pm, three stages of live music and inflatable fun for the kids (and ponies!).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nashvilleoktoberfest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Oktoberfest</a> promises petting zoo for the kids, polka dancing, three stages of live music, street performers, a Beer Garden, a tour of historic Germantown churches and food vendors of all sorts (and ponies!).</p><p>Both of the festivals run from 9am-6pm, but the ambitious Bier Runners will get going at 8am.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://historicgermantown.org/gsf.html\" target=\"_blank\">Historic Germantown Nashville</a>. </em></p>"}
