Hooray!). Here&#x2019;s our top picks for this weekend:</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=3628165\" target=\"_blank\">Arch Nemesiz w/ Modoc &amp; Jamie Grace featuring the debut of Little Filipino</a></strong>.&#xA0;<em>12th &amp; Porter, Friday, May 6, 8pm, $8.</em> It&#x2019;s time to party at 12th &amp; Porter, with local duo Arch Nemesiz headlining tonight&#x2019;s bill.&#xA0;One of Nashville&#x2019;s newest food trucks,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/04/28/little-filipino-egg-rolls-onto-the-nashville-food-truck-scene/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Filipino</a> will be doling out free egg rolls until they run out, and your $8 goes to benefit&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.peoplelovingnashville.com/peoplelovingnashville/peoplelovingnashville.html\" target=\"_blank\">People Loving Nashville</a>.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.tennesseecrafts.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TACA Tennessee Craft Fair</a></strong>.&#xA0;<em>Centennial Park, May 6-7, 10am-6pm; May 8, 10am-5pm, free. </em>The 40th annual TACA Spring Craft Fair kicks off today in Centennial Park, where you can see the fine handicrafts of over 170 Tennessean artisans.

This year they&#x2019;re going from city to city looking for amateur street skateboarders, and throwing a big ol&#x2019; competition to find the best in the US.

No word on how you can get into the block party without running the race, but we know you&#x2019;ll figure something out.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nashvilledowntown.com/play/first-saturday-art-crawl\" target=\"_blank\">First Saturday Art Crawl</a></strong>. <em>The Arcade/5th Ave between Church &amp; Union, Saturday, May 7, 6-9pm, free</em>.
