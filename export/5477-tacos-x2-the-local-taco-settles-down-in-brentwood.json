Now, owners John Ko, Jay Pennington and Michael Sloan hope to replicate their first location&#x2019;s success with The Local Taco, Brentwood edition, opening today on Pewitt Drive. If the trial run we got this weekend was any indication, they&#x2019;re certainly on the right track &#x2013; Local Taco fans and naysayers alike will want to give the new location a whirl.</p><p>Keeping in the spirit of the Sylvan Park store&#x2019;s fast, casual vibe, The Local Taco Brentwood will feature the familiar order-at-the-counter routine for lunch before morphing into a full table service restaurant for dinner. Expect an amped-up menu to match the service, thanks to the collaborative expertise of current Local Taco chef Therese Everette and former Zola owner &amp; chef Deb Paquette. On our trial run, we tasted duck taquitos, jumbo&#xA0;jalape&#xF1;o tater tots and smoked salmon along with an assortment of our favorite tacos from the current menu. And oh, the margaritas! The Brentwood bar played host to more delicious margarita and sangria flavors than we could count (especially after a glass or three), all made from scratch from fresh ingredients.</p><p>The Local Taco Brentwood is open from 11am-10pm at 146 Pewitt Drive (formerly Harpeth Grill, behind Judge Beans). <a href=\"http://twitter.com/thelocaltaco\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;twitter.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Follow them on Twitter</a> for daily specials, happy hour deals and mouth-watering brunch menus.
