Taking a look at some of the before and after photos of Earth Hour Nashville, we&#x2019;d say that our city had a whole lot to be proud of this weekend, even if <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/2k3g8\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Gifts decided to be a stick in the mud</a> and <a href=\"http://matthewhurtt.com/how-al-gore-celebrated-earth-hour/\" target=\"_blank\">Al Gore couldn&#x2019;t manage to turn off his giant flood lights</a>. But speaking of less-than-flattering environmental things, the TVA is taking some time out to hold <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10092855\" target=\"_blank\">a community open house today to answer folks&#x2019; questions about the Kingston cleanup efforts</a> which we feel confident will attract every protester within a 200-mile radius. Oi.</p><ul><li><strong>For me and you from the MTA.</strong> Thank you, Nashville MTA, for using some of that economic stimulus money to make riding the bus even&#x2026; less covenient than it already is? As of yesterday, they&#x2019;re <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10091595\" target=\"_blank\">no longer accepting credit and debit cards as payment for bus fares</a>. They&#x2019;ve also made changes to a few different routes, so check those out <a href=\"http://www.nashvillemta.org/PDF/2009_SystemChangesNashvilleMTA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Feeling stimulated.</strong> We had almost forgotten about Governor Phil&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=10085832\" target=\"_blank\">promise to take away our springtime Tax Free Weekend</a>, and by the looks of our state&#x2019;s current level brokeness, we feel like it&#x2019;s probably for the best. Have no fear, though&#x2013;we&#x2019;ll still get to shop tax-free in August.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>The state Senate votes today on <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10093498\" target=\"_blank\">whether or not we can cart booze</a> across the Tennessee border &#x2026; &#x201C;Nashville Jews <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090330/NEWS06/903300337/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">find kosher foods</a> in area supermarkets&#x201D; &#x2026; Another day, <a href=\"http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/03/29/state-house-bill-affects-use-of-invitrofertilization/\" target=\"_blank\">another controversial reproduction-related bill</a> in the Tennessee legislature &#x2026; At least one of your Nashvillest editors is supremely excited about the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090328/TUNEIN/90328005/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">new addition to Vanderbilt&#x2019;s Rites of Spring</a>.</li></ul><p><em>Photos courtesy of Will Wilson/McNeely, Piggot &amp; Fox, made flashy by us.</em></p>"}
