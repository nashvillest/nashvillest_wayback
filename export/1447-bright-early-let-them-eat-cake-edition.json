Things look pretty grim for Metro Nashville Public Schools this morning since the state has published a new report taking them to task for <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090114/NEWS04/901140398/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">failing yet again to follow orders that were intended to bring them up to federal standards</a>. Problem is, they seem to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. While they&#x2019;re supposed to be hiring 41 new people to fulfill requirements for adminstration, ESL, and special education, constant budget cuts have forced them into a hiring freeze. Just this month they&#x2019;ve been <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=65394\" target=\"_blank\">asked to cut an additional $4M</a> with more cuts expected in February. All we can say is that newly-hired director Jesse Register sure has his work cut out for him.</p><ul><li><strong>Killing us softly. </strong>Seems like everyone has a bone to pick with the TVA these days. As the result of a lawsuit filed by the State of North Carolina, they now have to put <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9667444\" target=\"_blank\">special pollution controls on the four coal-burning plants</a> closest to the border because of sulfur dioxide and other nasty stuff that floats into our neighboring state. And we <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/05/ask-mr-tim-dont-breathe-unless-you-have-to/\" target=\"_blank\">wonder why Nashville gets smoggy</a> in the summer.</li><li><strong>The old-fashioned way.</strong> About 250 students showed up for the <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090113/NEWS04/90113097/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">protest outside the Capitol yesterday regarding college tuition hikes</a> intended to save the state some money. A few of them succeeded in getting a meeting with the Governor, which we can imagine is no small feat on the first day of the General Assembly.</li><li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> We&#x2019;re pretty much going to be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090114/NEWS01/90114016/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">freezing our butts off</a> from now until Saturday afternoon, but we&#x2019;re sad because there&#x2019;s no snow in the forecast &#x2026; UT students aren&#x2019;t exactly happy with their <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090114/NEWS04/901140400/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">imminent tuition hikes</a> &#x2026; Dell-haters were vindicated yesterday when Dell had to settle with Tennessee and 45 other states for providing <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090113/BUSINESS01/901130325/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">crappy products and customer service</a> &#x2026; Volkswagen <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090113/BUSINESS01/901130319/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">promises they&#x2019;re not going anywhere</a> but the &#x2018;Noog.</li></ul><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/silenus81/3193167625/in/pool-nashvillest\" target=\"_blank\">Silenus81</a>.</em></p>"}
