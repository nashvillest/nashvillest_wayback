For those of you lucky enough to have the day off work, it&#x2019;s a great opportunity to check out the Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe exhibit before it closes on January 31. And you might even have the good fortune to catch one of your Nashvillest editors, grandmother in tow, taking advantage of the free admission while you&#x2019;re there!</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/brent_nashville/390037454/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SeeMidTN.com (aka Brent)</em></a><em>. </em></p>"
