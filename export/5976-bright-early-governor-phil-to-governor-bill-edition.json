The barrage of robocalls and campaign commercials is finally over, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/voter-turnout-normal-election-day-few-problems-reported?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" target=\"_blank\">Election Day went off (mostly) without a hitch</a>, and <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/haslam-wins-governorship-landslide?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)\" target=\"_blank\">our new governor-elect is Bill Haslam</a>, <a href=\"http://elections.tn.gov/Governor.htm\" target=\"_blank\">who raked in nearly double the votes that his Democratic opponent did</a>. Weirdly enough, <a href=\"http://www.carlwhitakerforgov.com/\" target=\"_blank\">this guy</a> came in third while <a href=\"http://www.jamesreesor.com/JamesReesorForGovernor.html\" target=\"_blank\">Crazy Man James</a> checked in near the bottom. Meanwhile Republicans gained enough ground in the state House of Representatives to take control, <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=21391\" target=\"_blank\">meaning that they now control both chambers and the governor&#x2019;s seat for the first time since the Civil War</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Some other notable races. </strong><a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13433152\" target=\"_blank\">State Rep. Diane Black won in the 6th</a>, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13434585\" target=\"_blank\">US Rep. Marsha Blackburn rallied past Greg Rabidoux in District 7</a>, <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13433714\" target=\"_blank\">US Rep Jim Cooper beat David Hall in District 5</a>, and <a href=\"http://wpln.org/?p=21374\" target=\"_blank\">Scott DesJarlais ousted Lincoln Davis in the 4th</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bust out the orange hats. </strong>And lastly, <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13433435\" target=\"_blank\">the constitutional amendment guaranteeing our right to hunt and fish passed</a>. Not that we couldn&#x2019;t hunt and fish before! This is just supposed to ensure that the government won&#x2019;t be able to revoke it without a very long and complicated process.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces. </strong>You know, it had really been too long since we saw <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13430967\" target=\"_blank\">a truck wedged beneath an overpass</a> &#x2026; Some folks are pretty outraged by a Facebook picture posted by State Rep. Teri Lynn Weaver featuring her <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/politics/25609669/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">posing with a person in blackface and the caption &#x201C;Aunt Jemima, you is so sweet.&#x201D;</a> &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101102/WILLIAMSON01/101102124/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">Who knew Williamson County had so many dang mayors?</a> &#x2026; The Preds feel like they really <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101103/SPORTS02/11030348/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">struck gold with rookie goalie Anders Lindback</a> &#x2026; Harding Place is <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101103/PROMO/101102119/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">getting some new sidewalks</a> soon &#x2026; The weatherpeople are <a href=\"http://nashvillewx.com/2010/11/a-little-rain-today-by-friday-much-cooler/\" target=\"_blank\">calling for a chance of SLEET/SNOW/SPRINKLES on Friday</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/helldorado666/5131309761/in/pool-715021@N24/\" target=\"_blank\">Hell Dorado</a>.</em></p>"
