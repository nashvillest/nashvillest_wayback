It reminds us of those good ol&#x2019; hurricane days in Virginia. [<a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9040483\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wkrn.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">WKRN</a>]</li>\n<li>We thought that less gas = less driving = less wrecks, but it seems that Nashville drivers are just as ruthless as ever. Three people died today in a crash that completely closed I-40E in Wilson County, and there were serious injuries in an accident that closed Hwy 96W this afternoon.

From the amount of time we spent driving around looking for gas last night, we&#x2019;d peg the percentage much higher. Oh, and they tossed in a little jab as well &#x2013; While we&#x2019;re seeing some serious supply and demand issues, it seems that our buddies in Knoxville are enjoying plummeting gas prices. Great.

[<a href=\"http://thatismessedup.com/2008/09/19/gas-siphoning/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;thatismessedup.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">That Is Messed Up</a>]</li>\n<li>Finally, some news that&#x2019;s not about gas or cars or plunder (ahoy!): The bed bugs are back.
