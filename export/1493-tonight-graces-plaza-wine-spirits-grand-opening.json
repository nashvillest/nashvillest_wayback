We know that Bud&#x2019;s and the Wine Shoppe aren&#x2019;t exactly happy about the development, but as residents of Green Hills, we&#x2019;ll welcome another booze supplier to the area with open arms. (Because sometimes, we just don&#x2019;t want to drive three blocks to pick up our vodka.) And even more welcome is <a href=\"http://www.graceswine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grace&#x2019;s Plaza Wine &amp; Spirits</a>&#x2018; grand opening celebration this evening from 5:30pm-7:30pm, where the wine will be flowing and the snacks will be&#x2026; Next door, because of Tennessee liquor laws. Food outside or not, we&#x2019;re excited to see what Grace&#x2019;s has to offer, and we&#x2019;ll probably be taking advantage of their 10% off anything in stock on opening night&#x2026; If you know what we mean. After all, we can always walk home.</p>"
