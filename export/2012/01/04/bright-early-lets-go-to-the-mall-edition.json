Almost two years after flooding in May 2010, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/flood-related-lawsuits-linger-ahead-opry-mills-opening?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News%29\" target=\"_blank\">Opry Mills mall is still in the midst of a complicated legal battle to get more money from its insurers</a>. Despite the lawsuits, the mall will finally reopen&#xA0;on March 29. The reopening will bring 3,000+ jobs back to the city and certainly help the state in the sales tax department.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pay the MTA</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/story/16436819/mta-bus-fares-increase-on-friday\" target=\"_blank\">Basic MTA cash bus fares will get bumped up by 10 cents on Friday</a> (20 cents if you use AccessRide). It&#x2019;s the first MTA price hike in 4 years, and officials attribute it to rising gas and other operating costs, plus expenses from the 2010 flood.</li>\n<li><strong>Frozen in place</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/16436715/officials-expected-cold-to-dislodge-occupy-protest\" target=\"_blank\">Despite Safety Department emails predicting that Occupy Nashville protesters would break camp when temperatures dropped</a>, the encampment is holding strong at Legislative Plaza and has even grown to approximately 60 tents (from 20 in October). Occupy Murfreesboro <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/story/16436715/officials-expected-cold-to-dislodge-occupy-protest\" target=\"_blank\">packed it in earlier this week</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bawk bawk bawk</strong>.

If passed, Metro residents could keep 2-6 backyard chickens for a $25 annual fee.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces</strong>.
