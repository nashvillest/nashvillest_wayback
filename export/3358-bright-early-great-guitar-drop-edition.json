Since last year&#x2019;s $250 Lynyrd Skynyrd concert fell flat and had to be canceled last-minute because tickets weren&#x2019;t selling, they&#x2019;re trying the free approach in an attempt to drum up some tourism downtown. The event&#x2013;which will feature a guitar drop (you know, instead of a ball drop?) and some musical acts including Rodney Atkins&#x2013;will cost the bureau somewhere in the six-figure ballpark.We sure hope it&#x2019;s worth it!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Richy Rich. </strong>Williamson County came in at <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/03/richest-counties-in-ameri_n_378287.html?slidenumber=%2Bcfn8SfIs1U%3D#slide_image\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.huffingtonpost.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">a cool #14 on the US Census Bureau&#x2019;s list of the richest counties in the country according to highest median incomes</a>. Almost all of the frontrunners were located in and around the DC and NYC metro areas, but Williamson managed to make the cut with a median income of $93,166.

Due to some pretty obvious budget constraints, the city is hoping to find some private funding sources for that leg of the project. If all goes as planned, the hotel should still open alongside the convention center in early 2013.</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> Martina McBride is now the <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/country-singer-buys-infamous-manning-jersey-fisher-wore?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">proud owner of that infamous Peyton Manning jersey</a> that Coach Fisher wore at the Rocketown event when the Titans were still sucking &#x2026; <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091204/BUSINESS01/912040347/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Hard Rock Cafe is reopening on Monday</a> after a renovation that nearly doubled their size and added an entertainment venue &#x2026; The state is<a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/32d50820-www.fox17.com.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.fox17.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"> restocking Tennessee rivers with 82,000 new trout</a> for fishin&#x2019; &#x2026; In case you missed it yesterday, <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/fanciful-bike-racks-coming-local-landmarks?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+%28Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville&#x2019;s new bike rack designs have been chosen</a> and <a href=\"http://nashvillecitypaper.com/files/citypaper/imagecache/story_center/images/farmers-market-bike-rack.jpg\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;nashvillecitypaper.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> is our favorite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theworldtoashes/3171226019/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>cdumo</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/12/15/bright-early-a-drop-in-the-bucket-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Bright &amp; Early: A Drop In The Bucket Edition\">Bright &amp; Early: A Drop In The Bucket Edition</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
