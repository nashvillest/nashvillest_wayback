On Monday, May 17, take your hard-earned dollars to some of Nashville&#x2019;s most generous restaurants, enjoy a delicious meal, pay up and go home knowing that a full 50% of your check is being donated to <a href=\"http://www.cfmt.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee</a> for flood relief! It&#x2019;s really that simple. After the chaos of the past two weeks, a nice sit-down meal is just what the doctor ordered for your Nashvillest editors&#x2026; And we have a feeling that most of our readers are in the same boat.</p><p>Here is the current list of participating restaurants, with more being added every day! Many restaurants are only participating during certain hours, so please call to confirm, hit up <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/eatoutfornashville\" target=\"_blank\">EatOutForNashville.org</a> (yes, it links to a Facebook page) or check back here on Monday for the final update. And last, but certainly not least, if you know of a restaurant that would like to participate, email <a href=\"mailto:eatoutfornashville@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">eatoutfornashville@gmail.com</a>. We&#x2019;d love to have more on board.
