This time around, Vanderbilt University is our shining star. As for our unemployment and mortgage rates, well, they&#x2019;re not so shiny. &#x201C;Tarnished,&#x201D; you might even say.</p>\n<p>Vanderbilt University scored 98th place on <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/01/22/vandy-makes-fortunes-best-places-to-work-list/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fortune&#x2019;s </em>100 Best Places To Work</a>, becoming the first school to ever make the list. When you look at it that way, 98th place sounds awesome! Vandy also came in 15th place on <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/01/05/daily16.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kiplinger&#x2019;s Personal Finance&#x2019;s </em>Best Value Schools</a>.</p>\n<p>A little south of Nashville, our neighbors in Franklin are also winning big. Franklin was named <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090108/NEWS03/90108070\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Southern Living&#x2019;s</em> 5th Best Small Town</a> in a recent Reader&#x2019;s Choice poll. The Williamson County Fair also just racked up a bunch of awards, though they&#x2019;re only ranked among other fairs in Tennessee (still, there&#x2019;s 60 of them, which is nothing to scoff at). <a href=\"http://tennessean.com/article/20090122/COUNTY090101/90122060/1164/COUNTY09\" target=\"_blank\">The Tennessee Association of Fairs</a> awarded them #1 Best Website, and they came in 2nd &amp; 3rd place in five other categories.</p>\n<p>Tennessee&#x2019;s unemployment rate <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/01/19/daily36.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">jumped to 7.9% in December</a>, which is not surprising, but thoroughly depressing all the same. We ranked <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/state_unemployment/\" target=\"_blank\">17th highest in the nation last month</a>, and when the nationwide numbers roll out next week, we&#x2019;re hoping we won&#x2019;t have moved too far up the list.</p>\n<p>Other than that, we tied for 1st place (with Colorado) in <a href=\"http://business.nashvillepost.com/2009/01/20/relatively-speaking-that-is/\" target=\"_blank\">Zillow.com&#x2019;s study on states with the highest mortgage rates</a>, and we failed miserably in the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/01/12/daily30.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">American Lung Association&#x2019;s State of Tobacco Control 2008 report</a> (we didn&#x2019;t know there was a test). This one was not ranked, rather, graded &#x2013; and we flunked with a C, a D, and two F&#x2019;s. That&#x2019;s a 0.75 GPA!</p>\n<p>And lastly, out of 56 major television markets, we ranked <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/01/19/daily26.html?ana=from_rss\" target=\"_blank\">#17 in viewership of the presidential nomination</a>. Not too shabby, we say.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/mad_african78/2959501609/\" target=\"_blank\">Mad Appler 78</a>. </em></p>"
