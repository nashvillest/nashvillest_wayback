Family Day means that the Frist Center is absolutely FREE from 1pm-5:30pm to everyone (not just families with kids). We love to take advantage of these free days whenever they happen, since the main exhibitions are different every time. There are several remarkable photography <a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/exhibitions/\" target=\"_blank\">exhibitions</a> up right now in additional to the special Family Day events &#x2013; Science experiments, story time, art projects, soap carving, live music and more.
