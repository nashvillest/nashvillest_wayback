We hail from Virginia, where the Italian Ice flows like water (and ironically is also known as Water Ice in select locations). A little birdie told us that two Rita&#x2019;s locations were coming to the Nashville area, and although they&#x2019;re inconveniently located in Hermitage and Mt. Juliet, we&#x2019;ll take what we can get.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ritasice.com/find-a-ritas/state-store-list.aspx?state=TN\" target=\"_blank\">Hermitage location</a> (4219 Lebanon Pike)&#xA0;is now open, and will be dishing out <strong>free regular sized Italian Ices</strong> through the end of next week. They&#x2019;re even open on Labor Day. Conveniently, we&#x2019;re off work on Labor Day, and it seems that a trip to Hermitage may be in our future. Rita&#x2019;s is famous for their freebies, generously giving away free ices on the first day of Spring every year as well. So that&#x2019;s two things to look forward to: Spring and Mt. Juliet. Oh, and we&#x2019;ve heard rumors of&#xA0;<em>sweet tea italian ice</em>. Stay southern, Rita&#x2019;s.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/drh/525371854/\" target=\"_blank\">Bright_Star</a>.
