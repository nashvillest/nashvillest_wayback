With more to explore but limited time, we waved goodbye to Kentucky and headed home. But who can pass up a trip to the <a href=\"http://franklindrive-in.com/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/franklindrive-in.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Franklin Drive-In</a>? It was right on our way back home, so convenient, so tempting&#x2026; So we gave in.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The Franklin Drive-In is right off I-65, just barely over the Kentucky border (around 45 miles away). We&#x2019;re warning you now &#x2013; if you map your trip online, you <em>will</em> get lost (we promise). Unless scenic trips through rural Kentucky are your thing, follow the directions until you get to the exit, and hang a right where it says to go left. We&#x2019;re obviously experts on getting lost in the area, but that&#x2019;s another story for another time.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Now, we know that there are a handful of drive-ins surrounding Nashville, and someday we&#x2019;ll review and compare them all. We like the Franklin Drive-In because they charge by the carload ($9) instead of per person, and they usually have fairly recent releases that pair well together. Don&#x2019;t expect them to always have an option for kids, though. They only have one screen, and a double feature can only cover so much territory. The 8pm movie will sometimes be family friendly, allowing time for those with young children to leave before the second flick.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>As far as drive-ins go, the Franklin Drive-In isn&#x2019;t fancy or modern. It&#x2019;s more like a screen in a giant gravel parking lot in a field in Kentucky, and the audio (FM) is pretty terrible (especially when those people around you run their engines for the a/c). But it&#x2019;s cheap, they have bathrooms, they have food, and it&#x2019;s the kind of fun that&#x2019;s almost been forgotten.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Photo from <a href=\"http://www.tn52.com/franklin_drive_in.htm\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.tn52.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">tn52.com</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/11/adventures-in-kentucky-dinosaur-world-field-trips/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Adventures In Kentucky: Dinosaur World [Field Trips]\">Adventures In Kentucky: Dinosaur World [Field Trips]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/14/adventures-in-kentucky-lets-go-back-field-trips/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Adventures in Kentucky: Let&#x2019;s Go Back [Field Trips]\">Adventures in Kentucky: Let&#x2019;s Go Back [Field Trips]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/08/12/adventures-in-kentucky-mammoth-cave-field-trips/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Adventures In Kentucky: Mammoth Cave [Field Trips]\">Adventures In Kentucky: Mammoth Cave [Field Trips]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/18/turtle-man-friends-dont-let-friends-go-to-kentucky/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Turtle Man: Friends Don&#x2019;t Let Friends Go To Kentucky\">Turtle Man: Friends Don&#x2019;t Let Friends Go To Kentucky</a></li>\n</ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"
