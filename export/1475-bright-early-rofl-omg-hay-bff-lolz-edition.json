With Metro Schools failing at pretty much everything these days, it&#x2019;s good to see people trying different things&#x2026; we guess. The principal of Hunters Lane High School recently gave her cell phone number out to every kid in the school and <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=9709832\" target=\"_blank\">asked them to text her because she feels like it&#x2019;s a good way to relate to them</a>. Back when we were young&#x2019;uns, cell phones were not allowed in school (and we had to walk to school uphill both ways in the Virginia Beach snow, etc.) so we&#x2019;re interested to see how this sort of thing will pan out.
