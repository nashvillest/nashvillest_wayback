They&#x2019;re dining through the city of Nashville one letter at a time, and from the looks of things, having as much fun as it sounds.</p><p>Alphabedible Adventures just wrapped up their &#x201C;I&#x201D; visit by checking out the International Market on Belmont Blvd. They&#x2019;ve got a running list of restaurants they visit on their A-Z foodie tour of Nashville, and sometimes they even let readers vote on their next destination. Each of their restaurant reviews is complete with clear photos and a solid critique of the food and atmosphere, making it one of our favorite foodie blog stops, even without the &#x201C;alphabedible&#x201D; twist.</p><p>Stay up to date with Alphabedible on Twitter at @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/alphabedible\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/twitter.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">alphabedible</a>, and subscribe to their RSS feed <a href=\"feed://alphabedibleadventures.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
