We hope you&#x2019;ll forgive us for adding to your Monday blues, but we&#x2019;re just telling it like it is. Our beloved city ranked as the <a href=\"http://consumerist.com/tag/unemployment/?i=5022176&amp;t=the-20-best-and-worst-cities-for-unemployment-benefits\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/consumerist.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">9th worst city for unemployment benefits</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;in a new study from the L.A.

So much so, that we landed on the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/06/30/daily4.html?ana=from_rss\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.bizjournals.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">Vacation Destinations For Residents of Michigan</a> charts at #4. We think AAA should find something better to do with their time than survey 8,500 Michiganians about their vacation habits, but at least we came out ahead this time.&#xC2;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/rachynymph/2101735153/\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/flickr.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>rachel.laureene</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/07/03/mixed-reviews-we-didnt-want-to-hear-that/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Mixed Reviews: We Didn&#x2019;t Want To Hear That\">Mixed Reviews: We Didn&#x2019;t Want To Hear That</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/22/drivers-ed-perhaps-mixed-reviews-by-people-who-dont-live-here/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Driver&#x2019;s Ed, Perhaps?
