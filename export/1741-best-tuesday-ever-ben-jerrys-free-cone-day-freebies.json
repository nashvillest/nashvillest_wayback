Hint: There really isn&#x2019;t a better way.&#xA0;</p><p>Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s annual <a href=\"http://benandjerrys.com/scoop-shops/feature/free-cone-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Cone Day</a> is here, and each of our local shops will be participating from <strong>noon to 8pm</strong> by dishing out a free scoop of your choosing. Don&#x2019;t be intimidated by long lines &#x2013; Our past experience is that Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s knows what they&#x2019;re doing, and they&#x2019;ll have you in and out again in no time.&#xA0;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s on Main St. in <a href=\"http://www.benjerry.com/franklin/\" target=\"_blank\">Franklin</a>, and there&#x2019;s also one on 21st in the <a href=\"http://www.benjerry.com/vanderbilt/\" target=\"_blank\">Midtown/Vanderbilt area</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>Free Cone Day is practically a national holiday by now, and we think we should have the day off work so that we can observe it&#x2026; But that&#x2019;s another story.&#xA0;</p><p>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nataliejohnson/2152487632/\" target=\"_blank\">nataliej</a>.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>"}
