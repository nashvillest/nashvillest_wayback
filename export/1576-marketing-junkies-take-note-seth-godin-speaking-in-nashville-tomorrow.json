The important part is that he&#x2019;s speaking tomorrow morning at the Nashville Convention Center as part of this year&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.crb.org/artman/publish/article_350.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Country Radio Seminar</a>, and it&#x2019;s open to the public&#x2026; For a price. Tickets are $40 (or $20 with a student ID) and can be purchased between 8-8:50am at the box office tomorrow morning for his keynote address at 10am. Everyone else stand back, because we&#x2019;d hate to see you trampled by the hordes of marketing peeps racing to their mecca.</p>"
