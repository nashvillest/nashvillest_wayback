Folks in Bellevue have been talking with the Metro Council about<a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=11880440\" target=\"_blank\"> rezoning the Bellevue Center Mall turned into another incarnation of Hillwood High School</a>, whose current building would be shut down. At the moment, the plan is to turn the mall into a mixed-use development (although&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100125/DAVIDSON/100125021/Crafton-considers-zone-change-for-Bellevue-Center\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Crafton</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/search/?q=bellevue+center+mall+ikea&amp;init=quick#/pages/Bring-I-K-E-A-to-the-Bellevue-Center-Mall-NOW/227034136284?ref=search&amp;sid=34100039.1250017315..1\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> seem to think they can convince someone to turn it into an IKEA), but not a whole progress has been made there.
