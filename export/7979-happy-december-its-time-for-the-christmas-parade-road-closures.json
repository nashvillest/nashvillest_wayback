Did this fact escape you too? The <a href=\"http://www.nashvillechristmasparade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">59th Annual Nashville Christmas Parade</a> will get started tonight at 7pm by crossing the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/12/02/bright-early-just-barge-on-in-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">totally-structurally-sound-despite-being-hit-by-a-barge Woodland Street Bridge</a>, then make its way down 2nd Avenue and Broadway before ending around Broadway &amp; 7th (<a href=\"http://www.nashvillechristmasparade.com/2011-ChristmasParadeMap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">map</a>). This year&#x2019;s parade is <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/16172559/nashville-christmas-parade\" target=\"_blank\">supposed to be the largest ever</a>, with grand marshal Vince Gill leading the way for over 80 parade participants. There will be floats, marching bands, giant inflatable things, gift-wrapped U-hauls, dance troupes, people in creepy costumes, the works! There&#x2019;s also the annual <a href=\"http://bigbrothersofnashville.org/events/150-2011-rudolphs-red-nose-run.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rudolph&#x2019;s Red Nose Run 5k </a>beforehand, if you&#x2019;re into that physical-activity-on-a-Friday-night sort of thing. You won&#x2019;t find us running, but you will find us bundled up, cheering, enjoying some uh,&#xA0;<em>specialty</em> hot chocolate from home and soaking in some holiday cheer.</p>\n<p><strong>5k &amp; Parade Schedule</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>6:00pm: Rudolph&#x2019;s Red Nose Run starts at LP Field (registration starts at 4:30pm)</li>\n<li>6:30pm: Lighting of the Nashville Christmas tree in Public Square Park with Mayor Karl Dean, Piedmont Natural Gas execs and Vince Gill</li>\n<li>7:00pm: Parade starts crossing Woodland Street Bridge</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Road Closures for Friday, December 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Closing at 4:30pm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Woodland Street westbound from 3rd&#xA0;Avenue to Interstate Drive</li>\n<li>North 1st Street from Jefferson Street to Woodland Street</li>\n<li>North 1st Street from Russell Street to Jefferson Street</li>\n<li>Titans Way</li>\n<li>Victory&#xA0;Avenue</li>\n<li>South 1st Street at Davidson Street</li>\n<li>2nd Avenue North between Church&#xA0;and Union Streets</li>\n<li>Russell Street from South 2nd Street to South 1st Street</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closing at 5:20pm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eastbound and Westbound lanes of Union Street (at 3rd Avenue North) to&#xA0;Woodland Street at Interstate Drive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closing at 5:30pm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broadway from 1st Avenue to 13th Avenue (including traffic crossing&#xA0;Broadway from 1st to 8th)</li>\n<li>Church Street from 3rd Avenue to&#xA0;1st Avenue</li>\n<li>1st Avenue from Demonbreun Street to Union Street</li>\n<li>2nd&#xA0;Avenue from Demonbreun Street to Union Street</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closing at 6:30pm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>9th Avenue South from Broadway to Demonbreun Street</li>\n<li>9th Avenue North from&#xA0;Broadway to Church Street</li>\n<li>10th Avenue North from Broadway to Charlotte Pike</li>\n<li>Commerce Street from 9th and 10th Avenues North</li>\n<li>Broadway from 1st&#xA0;to&#xA0;13th&#xA0;Avenues (including traffic crossing Broadway from 1st to 13th)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephenyeargin/4179378673/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Yeargin</a>, who is evidently the only person who takes pictures of the Nashville Christmas parade and puts them on Flickr. </em></p>"
