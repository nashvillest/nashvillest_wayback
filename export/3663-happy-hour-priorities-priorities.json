Which he emphasizes in this interview, over and over.

The owner of the store Hound Dogs is &#x201C;encouraging upset University of Tennessee fans not to burn their Lane Kiffin T-shirts, but to let him send them to Haiti.&#x201D; And if you donate your shirt, he&#x2019;ll give you 20% off of a brand new one. This sounds reasonable to us.
