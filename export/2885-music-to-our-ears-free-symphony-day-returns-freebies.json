Now, we&#x2019;re gearing up to attend the fourth year of completely free performances by some of the most talented musicians and ensembles around!</p><p>This year&#x2019;s Regions Free Day of Music will showcase more than 25 performances by names including Roy &#x201C;Futureman&#x201D; Wooten and the Black Mozart Ensemble, organist Wilma Jensen, Nashville Philharmonic, Nashville Symphony Chamber Chorus, Nashville Children&#x2019;s Choir and more. The music starts at 10am and runs for a full twelve hours, and the day ends with a bang, featuring a performance by the Nashville Symphony and some fun in the courtyard with Music City Swing.</p><p>In addition to the music, the Symphony box office will also be selling buy-one-get-one-free tickets to any Friday performance in the &#x2019;09/&#x2019;10 season, an appeal to us cheapskates that storm the doors on free day. And hey, it works!
