Predictably, that epic ice storm we were promised seems to be <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9734125\" target=\"_blank\">wreaking all sorts of havoc everywhere but here</a>. We&#x2019;ll be seeing buckets and buckets of rain throughout the day and into tomorrow morning, but rain doesn&#x2019;t exactly get us off the hook for work. If we start praying now, maybe <a href=\"http://www.groundhog.org/info/\" target=\"_blank\">the groundhog</a> will sentence us to another six weeks of winter next week and we&#x2019;ll have a few more chances at <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090127/NEWS01/901270346\" target=\"_blank\">an ice storm we can call our own</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Secret&#x2019;s out. </strong>Just a few minutes ago, the Election Commission went public with Nashville English First&#x2019;s finance reports, which they finally filed a few days after the election. Not surprisingly, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090127/NEWS0206/90127008\" target=\"_blank\">about 90% of their money came from the group ProEnglish</a> based out of Arlington, Virginia which has ties to at least one organization (<a href=\"http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer\" target=\"_blank\">FAIR</a>) that has been declared a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</li>\n<li><strong>In the hot seat.</strong> The TVA will be <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090126/NEWS01/90126069/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">making an appearance before the Metro Council</a> next month to answer some question about why the heck our electric bills are so high. We can&#x2019;t wait to hear this one!</li>\n<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> If you&#x2019;re one of the people <a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/global/story.asp?s=9736291\" target=\"_blank\">still rocking the analog television</a>, Congress might have just bought you some more time &#x2026; A gun was <a href=\"http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=65654\" target=\"_blank\">confiscated from a 17-year old</a> at McGavock High yesterday &#x2026; The Loews Vanderbilt Hotel was packed with stars last night to <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090127/COLUMNIST0501/901270357/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">celebrate all the Grammy nominees</a> in this town &#x2026; Times are getting so tough here that people are <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090127/NEWS01/901270353/-1/RSS05\" target=\"_blank\">selling their wedding rings on Craigslist</a>&#x2013;though this <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/09/09/a-match-made-in-heaven-gems-from-the-nashville-craigslist/\" target=\"_blank\">wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/greystgirl/3135619639/\" target=\"_blank\">Grey Street Girl</a>.</em></p>"
