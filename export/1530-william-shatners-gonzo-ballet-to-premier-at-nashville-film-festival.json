The film chronicles the determination of choreographer Margo Sappington to, um, boldly go where no man has gone before and turn Shatner&#x2019;s album <em>Has Been</em> into a ballet. Naturally, old Captain Kirk himself will be in town for the screening alongside Ben Folds, who co-wrote <em>Has Been</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The disc was recorded in Nashville, and featured songs that [Shatner] co-wrote, with contributions from Henry Rollins, Joe Jackson, Aimee Mann, Brad Paisley and Folds. The finished ballet, <em>Common People</em>, is set to six songs from <em>Has Been</em> and was captured on film when it debuted along with the Milwaukee Ballet in 2007.

Heck, we just want the chance to see The Shat wandering around Nashville.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/la_belle_province/557227762/\" target=\"_blank\">La Belle Province</a>.<br>\n</em></p>"
