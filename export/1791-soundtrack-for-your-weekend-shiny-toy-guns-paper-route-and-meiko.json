Not that three days of music is necessarily unusual here in the Music City, but three days of music that we actually <em>want</em> to hear? A rare occurrence indeed!</p><p>Tonight, check out <a href=\"http://www.ticketbiscuit.com/exitin/EventPage.aspx?EID=30251&amp;VD=4/1/2009&amp;\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketbiscuit.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shiny Toy Guns</strong> at the Exit/In</a>. We&#x2019;ve heard that Shiny Toy Guns shows turn into pretty epic dance parties, and what better way is there to spend your Friday night? Opening for Shiny Toy Guns are local bands Autovaughn and Mike&#x2019;s Pawn Shop. The show starts at 9pm (doors at 8pm) and it&#x2019;s $15 at the door.</p><p>Saturday night, get to the Exit/In early for the <strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketbiscuit.com/exitin/EventPage.aspx?EID=30249&amp;VD=4/1/2009&amp;\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketbiscuit.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Paper Route CD release show</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.ticketbiscuit.com/exitin/EventPage.aspx?EID=30249&amp;VD=4/1/2009&amp;\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketbiscuit.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"> with Mikky Ekko and Brian Lee &amp; His Orchestra</a>. The internet has been buzzing with cries of &#x201C;ZOMG PAPER ROUTE IS AWESOME!!1&#x2033; since their new CD, &#x201C;Absence,&#x201D; released on Tuesday, and this could be one of your last chances to catch these hometown heroes before they blow up. The last Paper Route show at the Exit/In was ridiculously packed, so stake out a spot early if you plan on maintaining a shred of comfort. Show starts at 9pm, and it&#x2019;s only $12 at the door.</p><p>Sunday night, if you&#x2019;re not worn out from Friday and Saturday&#x2019;s shows, come hang at 3rd &amp; Lindsley to see one of our absolute favorite artists, <strong>Meiko</strong>. Meiko keeps coming through Nashville, and we keep missing her, but we&#x2019;ve vowed that this will be the day. She&#x2019;ll be playing with <strong>Cory Chisel</strong> and <strong>Trey Lockerbie</strong>, and the show is only <a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=1265294\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.ticketweb.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">$12 in advance</a> (but with service fees, ends up around $15). Doors are at 6pm and the show starts at 7pm.</p><p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/opendemocracy/542471395/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>openDemocracy</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/05/01/the-weekendist-get-out-your-rainboots-edition/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Weekendist: Get Out Your Rainboots Edition\">The Weekendist: Get Out Your Rainboots Edition</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
