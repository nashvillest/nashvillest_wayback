Between Saturday&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.soundforest.org/event_registration.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bike For Branches</a> and Sunday&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.muddybuddy.com/events.php?id=10\" target=\"_blank\">Muddy Buddy Ride &amp; Run</a>, even the most enthusiastic fitness buffs should be pretty worn out. It&#x2019;s not too late to register for either one, so if your weekend is clear and you&#x2019;re feeling up to the challenge, sign up for one or both!&#xA0;</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.soundforest.org/event_registration.html\" target=\"_blank\">BIKE FOR BRANCHES<br></a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Bike For Branches is a leisurely seven-mile ride past some of Nashville&#x2019;s oldest and largest trees. The route is very appropriate, because the money raised by Bike For Branches will go toward planting more trees in the area. They&#x2019;ll even send you the GPS location of the tree they plant in your name! If a bike ride sounds a little too ambitious on your Saturday afternoon, you can still support the cause by attending the Bike For Branches outdoor music festival immediately following the ride. Featuring local artists&#xA0;The Elmwood Band,&#xA0;Michael Ford Jr &amp; The Apache Relay,&#xA0;Bobby Hamrick Band,&#xA0;The Delta Saints,&#xA0;Michael Ford Jr &amp; The Apache Relay,&#xA0;The Gabe Dixon Band,&#xA0;The Bluff,&#xA0;Sharon Lang and&#xA0;Denitia Odigie, the 12 South district will be seeing quite the lively evening.&#xA0;</span></strong></p><p>Bike For Branches will take place in 12 South&#x2019;s Sevier Park. Event registration begins at 2pm, bike ride begins at 3pm, after-ride drinks at the 12 South Taproom at 4pm and the outdoor music festival begins at 4:30pm. Registration for the bike ride &amp; music festival is $25, festival only tickets are $15.&#xA0;</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.muddybuddy.com/events.php?id=10\" target=\"_blank\">MUDDY BUDDY RIDE &amp; RUN</a><br><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The leisurely pace of Saturday&#x2019;s Bike For Branches is a very good thing for those participating in both events this weekend, because the Muddy Buddy Ride &amp; Run is anything but leisurely. Teams of two will compete in this half riding, half running the nearly seven-mile race, completing obstacles along the way and finishing it off in a big pit of mud. Wondering where there&#x2019;s a big mud pit in Nashville? There isn&#x2019;t one. The competition will actually take place in Ashland City, in the Cheatham Wildlife Management Area.&#xA0;</span></strong></p><p>Muddy Buddy Ride &amp; Run packet pickup will begin at 6am (or pick them up on Saturday at REI in Brentwood), with the race beginning at 8am sharp. After the race, all participants 21+ are entitled to two complimentary beers, which sounds like the perfect way to cap off a muddy morning. <a href=\"http://www.active.com/page/Event_Details.htm?event_id=1660444&amp;assetId=ba3a75d0-c963-495e-a904-d41cc0c147fb\" target=\"_blank\">Register here</a> in teams of two ($150 per team).&#xA0;</p><p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevineddy/2495765010/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kevin Eddy</em></a><em>.</em></p>"}
