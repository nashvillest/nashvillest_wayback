So this weekend wasn&#x2019;t quite as relaxing as we&#x2019;d hoped, but somehow despite the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/07/04/steve-mcnair-found-shot-to-death-on-4th-of-july-rip/\" target=\"_blank\">craziness of Steve McNair&#x2019;s death</a>, our souvenir sunburns from the <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/30/hot-holidays-with-hot-chicken-music-city-hot-chicken-festival/\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Chicken Festival</a>, and The Great Fireworks Monsoon of &#x2018;09, we&#x2019;ve still rolled into Monday morning in once piece. As of this morning, developments in the McNair case are still dominating the headlines: Investigators have now confirmed that <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10646820\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">he and Saleh Kazemi were definitely dating</a>, neighbors are saying that they <a href=\"http://www.newschannel5.com/global/story.asp?s=10646890\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.newschannel5.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">often saw Titans hanging out at her apartment</a>, and <a href=\"http://remarkablehomes.blogspot.com/2009/07/steve-mcnair-house-in-green-hills-area.html\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/remarkablehomes.blogspot.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">someone</a> even dug up <a href=\"http://www.homesbysylvester.com/Listing/ViewListingDetails.aspx?ListingID=3189327&amp;ShowCompact=false&amp;Preview=false&amp;new=false&amp;LastTabIndex=-1&amp;BackEmailID=-1&amp;BackEmailTypeID=NONE\" onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outbound/article/www.homesbysylvester.com&apos;);\" target=\"_blank\">a bunch of pictures of his Green Hills home that was up for sale</a>. As details continue to come out, we&#x2019;re still incredibly saddened by whole situation and kind of wish this weekend had never happened.
