There&#x2019;s plenty to do in Nashville this weekend, so stop moping around and take a trip to the Frist, the Adventure Science Center or check out a sports game. Here are our picks for this weekend:</p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://grimeys.com/news.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amos Lee Grimey&#x2019;s Instore</a></strong>. <em>12pm, free</em>. Tonight&#x2019;s Amos Lee show at the Ryman may be sold out, but if you&#x2019;re not tethered to a desk all day, you&#x2019;ve got a shot to see an intimate Amos Lee acoustic performance for free! We&#x2019;re not really big fans of this whole new &#x201C;instores at noon&#x201D; thing that Grimey&#x2019;s has got up their sleeves (you know, day jobs and all that), but we won&#x2019;t begrudge the rest of you your joy. Line up early and all that jazz.</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://fristcenter.org/site/calendar/eventdetail.aspx?cid=946\" target=\"_blank\">The Frist Center&#x2019;s 10th Birthday</a></strong>. <em>April 8-9, free</em>! The Frist is turning ten and everyone is invited to come to the party. Enjoy free admission all day Friday (10am-9pm) and Saturday (10am-5:30pm), and take part in all of the birthday festivities.</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://predators.nhl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Preds vs. Blue Jackets</a></strong>. <em>Bridgestone Arena, </em><em>7pm, ticket prices vary</em>. The Preds&#x2019; final home game of the regular season is here. Send &#x2019;em out in style with a sold out crowd!</li></ul><p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=213643421984159\" target=\"_blank\">Lightning 100&#x2019;s Music City Mayhem</a></strong>. <em>Exit/In, 8pm, free</em>. If you&#x2019;ve tuned in to Lightning 100 at all in the past few weeks, you&#x2019;ve probably heard local bands battling, bracket style, for the title of Music City Mayhem Champ! The Final Four &#x2013; Eastern Block, Ravello, The Cold Stares, Newmatic &#x2013; will be facing off this Saturday at the Exit/In. It&#x2019;s a free show, and attendees choose the winner.</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.sudekumplanetarium.com/features/2011/04/astroday.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Second Saturday at the Adventure Science Center</a></strong>. 6pm<em>-12am, $4-8</em>. The Adventure Science Center rarely stays open late, but when they do, you know it&#x2019;s something good. This weekend they&#x2019;re keeping the planetarium open for a full night of planetarium programs and laser shows, so get ready to star-gaze (or listen to Pink Floyd, whatever). And the best part? There&#x2019;s no general admission charge, so you just pay for the planetarium show ($4 members/$6 non-members) or laser show ($6 members/$8 non-members). There&#x2019;s five shows to choose from, plus a free outdoor Star Party at 8!</li></ul><p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://nashville.sounds.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t556\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville Sounds vs. New Orleans Zephyrs</a>. </strong><em>Greer Stadium, 2:05pm, ticket prices vary</em>. The Sounds will wrap up their first series of the season this Sunday, and while you can catch other games on Friday or Saturday, Sunday is our pick. Why? It&#x2019;s Purity Sundae Sunday, that&#x2019;s why. Ice cream sundaes for $1 at a baseball stadium, it doesn&#x2019;t get much better than that.</li></ul><p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/laserbub/3649547348/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>laserbub</em></a><em>.</em></p>"}
