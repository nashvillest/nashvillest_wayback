At any rate, the reactions around town have been mixed, but the overall consensus is the same: We&#x2019;re short on cash. Mayor Dean announced this morning that all departments would be operating with significantly smaller budgets this year with the exception of Metro Public Schools, which will <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/16250119/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\">receive about half</a> of the $1.58 billion budget. Why? To put it simply, things aren&#x2019;t going real well. The school system as a whole is facing the possibility of a state intervention within the next two years if they continue to fall short of meeting No Child Left Behind requirements&#x2013;something that Dean says is &#x201C;not something we want to happen.&#x201D; No kidding.</p><p><span id=\"more-41\"></span></p><p>Between that and the 200 layoffs, it was a pretty grim address. He did try to focus on the positives, such as the $1M proposal for a new DNA crime lab for the Metro Police, Maplewood High School&#x2019;s football state championship outing, and Nashville being chosen as one of two cities for an Alternative High School pilot initiative (we&#x2019;re not really sure what that is, either.) <a href=\"http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/pitw/2008/05/dean_ducks_tax_issue_in_state.php\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;blogs.nashvillescene.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Pith In The Wind</a> isn&#x2019;t buying it, though, saying he played up the smaller issues to skirt around the revenue shortfall.</p><p>On a related note, we feel like we almost <em>have</em> to send you over to News Channel 4 to watch the <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/video/16253488/index.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">wonderfully awkward video</a> segment on the address. Lots of awkward lulls, and also, if you&#x2019;re one of the 5,000 Nashvillians between the ages of 16 and 24 who&#x2019;s not in school, Channel 4 thinks you&#x2019;re a &#x201C;very hopeless and very dangerous&#x201D; person.
