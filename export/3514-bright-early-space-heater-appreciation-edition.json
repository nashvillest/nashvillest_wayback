With the frigid temperatures finally rearing their ugly heads in the past few weeks, it&#x2019;s that time of year where many of us bust out the space heaters and complain about how cold it is in the office. However, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/21988555/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">the kids of Shayne Elementary School of Nolensville Road have gone without heat for nearly a week</a>. One student&#x2019;s mother finally called up WSMV to get the story out and now it seems that Metro is scrambling to get the problem under control. Stay warm, kiddos!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vaccine recalls. </strong>As part of the nationwide recall of children&#x2019;s Swine Flu vaccines, <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20091216/NEWS07/91216054/-1/RSS05\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.tennessean.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">Tennessee has seen 11,210 doses yanked off the market</a>. State health officials want to emphasize, however, that the vaccines were perfectly safe; they just weren&#x2019;t as strong as they needed to be.</li>\n<li><strong>Volunteer state. </strong>According to the IRS,<a href=\"http://www.fox17.com/template/inews_wire/wires.regional.tn/2dd5e69f-www.fox17.com.shtml\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.fox17.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\"> Tennesseans gave at least $3.8 billion in charitable donations last year</a>. This number only includes donations that were deducted from federal tax returns, so the actual figure is probably a lot higher.
