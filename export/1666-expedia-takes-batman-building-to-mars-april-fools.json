Now that we have that out of the way, we&#x2019;d like to take you to examine Expedia&#x2019;s April Fools joke, <a href=\"http://www.expedia.com/daily/mars/hotels-mars/?mcicid=Mars_us\" target=\"_blank\">flights &amp; hotels to Mars</a>. Look around closely. Does anything look familiar to you? Check out Hotel Package #4, the <em>Utopia Spa &amp; Resort from $53,086.00</em>. Is it looking more familiar now? Yes folks, that is the AT&amp;T tower in downtown Nashville, aka the Batman building, also apparently doubling up as the <strong>Utopia Spa &amp; Resort on Mars</strong>! We never knew! And it sounds like a great place to stay, too:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Revel in the idyllic setting of the Utopia Spa &amp; Resort. Find peace of mind millions of miles from home with spa treatments unique to Mars, including the Martian heated rock massage and Martian-mud red facial. Tours of the nearby space shipyard are available via appointment only.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Photo&#xA0; by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/exothermic/2332679861/\" target=\"_blank\">Exothermic</a></em>. <em>Thanks to Matt W. for the tip!</em></p>"
