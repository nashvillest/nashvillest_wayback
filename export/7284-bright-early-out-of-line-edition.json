We can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;ve just been sitting and suffering through the deafening drone of the cicadas for the past few weeks when we could have been phoning in a noise complaint, which is<a href=\"http://www.wkrn.com/story/14842189/man-calls-911-complains-of-cicadas\" target=\"_blank\"> exactly what one Cookeville man did last week</a>. He thought the noise was coming from loud machinery, and sheriff&#x2019;s deputies had to break the news that the noise won&#x2019;t stop for another week or so. Unfortunately, WKRN reports that &#x201C;no cicadas were arrested on the noise complaint.&#x201D;</p><ul><li><strong>Down in flames</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/28139732/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trace Adkins&#x2019; Brentwood house burned to the ground on Saturday</a> as he was on a flight en route to Alaska.
