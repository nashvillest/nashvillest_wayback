Unfortunately, tickets aren&#x2019;t six bucks&#x2026; But, lucky you, Nashvillest has got your back! <a href=\"http://shows.travelzoo.com/shows-events/519739?utm_source=top20_us&amp;utm_medium=email_top20\" target=\"_blank\">Travelzoo has a discount code</a> that will net you 50% off your circus ticket purchase. You may end up shelling out more than what you saved on those pesky Ticketmaster service fees, but alas, there is no discount code for that. And pay attention: That code only works for the Saturday &amp; Sunday shows.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Performance times and tickets for <em>Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey: Over The Top</em> can be <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/venueartist/221417/1244295\" target=\"_blank\">found here</a>. <em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jimreams/status/1119298299\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Reams</a> for tipping us off!</em>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/branditressler/2771804100/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ladybugbkt</em></a><em>.</em></p>"
