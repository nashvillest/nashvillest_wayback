If you don&#x2019;t, here&#x2019;s a refresher: It&#x2019;s that camp that cost eight grand (that&#x2019;s $8,000.00) to attend, carted rabid country music fans around in tour busses for five days, and featured private performances from the likes of John Rich.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re terribly sorry to inform you that <a href=\"http://www.campnashville.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Camp Nashville has been &#x201C;postponed&#x201D;</a> until 2010 due to the state of the economy. We like to think that it&#x2019;s due to the fact that it cost $8,000, but that&#x2019;s just us.
