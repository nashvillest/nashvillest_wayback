Luckily Nashvillest has your back, and we want to give you a heads-up on how you can avoid getting yourself stuck in the worst traffic jam of your life. Although the festival doesn&#x2019;t start until Thursday, the city will start closing down streets as early as tomorrow morning. We&#x2019;re just not sure which streets and when. CMA sent out a press release that we can&#x2019;t make much sense out of, but we&#x2019;ll go ahead and repost it anyway in hopes that you&#x2019;ll have better luck deciphering it than we did. We tried getting a hold of CMA for clarification, but we&#x2019;re guessing they&#x2019;re swamped.</p><blockquote><p>On Tuesday, one lane of Fifth Avenue from Demonbreun to Broadway will be closed.</p><p>Wednesday, June 4, Fifth Avenue from Demonbreun to Broadway will close as will First Avenue from Demonbreun to Church Street.</p><p>Broadway from First and Third Avenues will also be closed Wednesday. Second Avenue will remain open but vehicles will be prohibited from turning at the Broadway and Second Avenue intersection.</p><p>Beginning in the afternoon Wednesday, June 4, there will also be temporary road closures for the CMA festivals kick-off parade and block party. At 2:00 p.m., Broadway and Demonbreun will close from Third to Seventh avenues and Third and Fourth avenues will close from Broadway to Demonbreun. These roads will re-opened at the end of the parade around 3 p.m.</p><p>All traffic returns to normal Monday, June 9.</p></blockquote><p>Which roads will be closed Thursday through Sunday? Your guess is as good as ours. But now you&#x2019;ll at least know how not to get yourself stuck in the parade traffic on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> If you&#x2019;re looking for the CMA Festival street closures for 2009, <a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/09/cma-music-festival-road-closures-cmapocalypse-2009/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/strangeworksonline/172308405/\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;flickr.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">strange librarian</a>.</em></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/06/09/cma-music-festival-road-closures-cmapocalypse-2009/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: CMA Music Festival Road Closures [CMApocalypse 2009]\">CMA Music Festival Road Closures [CMApocalypse 2009]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2010/06/07/clear-the-roads-cmapocalypse-10-is-coming-road-closures/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Clear The Roads: CMApocalypse &#x2019;10 Is Coming [Road Closures]\">Clear The Roads: CMApocalypse &#x2019;10 Is Coming [Road Closures]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2011/06/06/the-po-po-shut-us-down-road-closures-cmapocalypse-11/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Po Po Shut Us Down [Road Closures] [CMApocalypse \" 11]'=\"\">The Po Po Shut Us Down [Road Closures] [CMApocalypse &apos;11]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2008/11/11/road-closures-for-cma-awards-cmapocalypse-2008/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Road Closures for CMA Awards [CMApocalypse 2008]\">Road Closures for CMA Awards [CMApocalypse 2008]</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/11/10/brace-yourselves-for-impact-its-cmapocalypse-09-road-closures10/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Brace Yourselves For Impact: It&#x2019;s Veterans CMApocalypse &#x2019;09 [Road Closures]\">Brace Yourselves For Impact: It&#x2019;s Veterans CMApocalypse &#x2019;09 [Road Closures]</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
