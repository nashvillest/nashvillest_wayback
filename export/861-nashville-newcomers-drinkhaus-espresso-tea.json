That&#x2019;s the only explanation we&#x2019;ve been able to come up with as we watch infant businesses spring up on every corner. Not that we&#x2019;re complaining. We took a trip to Germantown this weekend to welcome the newest of the bunch into the fold. Meet <a href=\"http://drinkhaus.com\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;drinkhaus.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">DrinkHaus</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>Germantown was quiet on Saturday afternoon with no more than four cars in sight around the Summer Street Lofts. When we made our way into DrinkHaus (500 Madison Street, #103)&#xA0;it was empty, but by the time we left 20 minutes later, several people had passed through. The decor inside was bright, clean and modern, but it&#x2019;s tiny.&#xA0;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2796201903_a23c264d78.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>We tried a DrinkHaus exclusive, the orange zest cappuccino. It had a unique and pleasant flavor, although the large shavings of orange peel made it hard to sip. We also ordered an iced chai, which was pleasant (but made from a concentrate). The real treat was DrinkHaus&#x2019; gelato. We decided to try the mango blood orange gelato, and it was nothing short of incredible. It was smooth and creamy, and the flavor was a perfect blend of mango and blood orange. We&#x2019;ve already decided to go back to try some of the interesting blends of organic teas available, but it&#x2019;s really just an excuse to get some more gelato.&#xA0;</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/08/07/caffeinated-birthdays-have-your-cake-and-coffee-too/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Caffeinated Birthdays: Have Your Cake And Coffee Too\">Caffeinated Birthdays: Have Your Cake And Coffee Too</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nashvillest.com/2009/04/24/nashville-newcomers-fleur-de-lis-flavors-throws-new-orleans-snowballs-at-us/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Nashville Newcomers: Fleur de Lis Flavors Throws New Orleans Snowballs At Us\">Nashville Newcomers: Fleur de Lis Flavors Throws New Orleans Snowballs At Us</a></li></ol></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--END .entry-content .article-->"}
