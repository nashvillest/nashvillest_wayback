Last week, we had some fun with the news that the Sommet Center could soon be getting a new name&#x2026; again. The Nashville Hockey Club had a falling out with the Sommet Group over Sommet&#x2019;s alleged failure to make the payments that were part of the naming deal, but Sommet insisted that the Nashville Hockey Club had violated their contract by using competing vendors. Anyway, <a href=\"http://www.wsmv.com/news/21794544/detail.html\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;www.wsmv.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuits were filed and the name change could happen as early as today at a special meeting called by the Metro Sports Authority</a>.

Not only is he trying to do that, but he&#x2019;s also requesting that <em>Sports Illustrated</em> feature him on the cover. And challenging Celtics guard Rajon Rondo, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ChrisJohnson28/status/6215248269\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push([&apos;_trackEvent&apos;,&apos;outbound-article&apos;,&apos;twitter.com&apos;]);\" target=\"_blank\">via Twitter</a>, to a foot race and a basketball game.
