		<description>You can&#039;t miss it! It&#039;s technically at the bandshell (on the West End side of the Parthenon) but you won&#039;t be able to miss the crowd. </description>

		<description>They usually make the call a few hours before the event. Depends on if lightning is in the forecast or not usually. You can watch our twitter (twitter.com/nashvillest) or the Nashville Scene&#039;s twitter (twitter.com/nashvillescene) for the update. We also always update this post when we hear of cancelations. </description>

		<description>How will I know if the movie has been cancelled due to weather?  Will they cancel only if it is raining at sunset or will they cancel if it&#039;s in the forecast?  Thanks SO much !</description>

		<description>Yep! 

Q. Can I bring my dog?A. Dogs are welcome, but they must be on a leash at all times. Be considerate and pick up any doggie leftovers. Dog cages and/or pens are not allowed. </description>
