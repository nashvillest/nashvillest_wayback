		<description>I just want to say that it&#039;s not just the motorists that need to watch for the pedestrians and cyclists. I have had several people walk or cycle out in front of me when I have had a green light. Most pedestrians ignore the walk/don&#039;t walk signs at crosswalks or just cross in the middle of traffic.
Cyclists need to follow the rules of the road as well. They need to remember that people can&#039;t see them as well as they can a vehicle. They need to get out of that &quot;oh, they&#039;ll slow down in time&quot; mindset.</description>
