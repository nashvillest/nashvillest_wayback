		<description>Yeah, I&#039;ve read before that it varies by county. But... seriously? Passengers can booze it up as long as it&#039;s in a plastic container?</description>

		<description>Although the open container law doesn&#039;t apply to passengers in TN, the open container law DOES extend to passengers in Metro Nashville-Davidson County per ordinance 7.24.040...unless the container is plastic.</description>

		<description>re: stink bugs - Noooooo!! These are horrible! Started a few years ago in the northeast/mid-Atlantic. Every time I speak to someone back in Maryland, they&#039;re complaining about them. 

i.e. My friend was eating yogurt in her house, and one landed (yes, they fly.) on her spoon. My aunt has awoken to them in her hair. My uncle had to take the curtains down in his house because the stink bugs congregated (in hundreds) behind them...and he&#039;s not doing his garden this year because they ruined all his produce last year. 

WaPo Q&amp;A about them: http://wapo.st/gTYRbo 

They came from Asia and we don&#039;t have their predator here in the States - apparently some type of wasp or hornet. Wouldn&#039;t want those either :-/

Hoping maybe the following solution/spray could help?? Hopefully...nothing else has.

My brother used to vacuum them up by the hundreds (they let out the stink when squished), but the vacuum started smelling too much. </description>
