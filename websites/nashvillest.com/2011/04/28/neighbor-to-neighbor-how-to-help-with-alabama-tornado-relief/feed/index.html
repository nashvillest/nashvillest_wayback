		<description>There&#039;s also a lot of need in Cleveland. They&#039;re a small town (northeast of Chattanooga), but not getting the media attention that the more damaged areas have gotten, and thus not getting as much help as they need… 9 dead, 300+ homes destroyed, many others with severe damage, in a small town of about 40,000. Here are some links for how to help:
