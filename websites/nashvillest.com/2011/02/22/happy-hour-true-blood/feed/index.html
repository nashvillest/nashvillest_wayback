		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a really good point. And a possibility. My husband recently mailed a check from Murfreesboro to the Murfreesboro Electric Dept. to pay our electric bill and it took almost an entire month to get processed. Who knows if it was lost in the mail for a while or what, but yeah—what about people who&#039;s payments are delayed for legitimate reasons?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, standard is about two months for late bills before water is shut off. That, I understand. But ten days!? And they&#039;re also proposing a fee to turn it back on once it&#039;s been shut off. I&#039;m all about people paying their bills on time, but that&#039;s just kicking people while they&#039;re down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, if my water bill is $60/month I can&#039;t imagine what the bill looks like for people with families, or more than two people in a household. No wonder so many people are paying their bills late, Murfreesboro!]]></description>
