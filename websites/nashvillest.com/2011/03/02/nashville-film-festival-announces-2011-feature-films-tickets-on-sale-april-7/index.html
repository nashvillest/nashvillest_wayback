<p>The 2011 Nashville Film Festival is just around the corner and we have a feeling that our expectations for the best fest ever are right on track. The festival announced this year&#8217;s feature films in competition and major categories today, including Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&#8221; (Winner of the Palm d’Or at Cannes 2010), Cindy Meehl&#8217;s “Buck&#8221; (Audience Award for Best Documentary at Sundance 2011) and Alrick Brown’s “Kinyarwanda&#8221; (Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at Sundance 2011). <a href="http://nashvillefilmfestival.org/press/2011-nashville-film-festival-presented-nissan-announces-feature-films-competition-and-major-ca" target="_blank">Straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Winner of the Palm d’Or at Cannes, Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives,” a natural, free-wheeling, pensive and dryly funny film combining Buddhist belief, cinematic history, and Northern Thailand folklore, will join more than a dozen international films in the World Cinema category. Joining “Uncle Boonmee…” in the category will be “Buck,” American director Cindy Meehl’s portrait of Buck Brannaman, the inspiration for “The Horse Whisperer.” The film picked up the Audience Award for Best Documentary at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. Also of note in World Cinema is veteran Japanese filmmaker Takashi Mikke’s “13 Assassins” and Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Frammartino’s “Le Quattro Volte (The Four Times).”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the Narrative Competition Presented by Bridgestone, director Alrick Brown’s “Kinyarwanda,” winner of the Audience Award from Best Narrative Feature at Sundance, is based on true accounts from survivors during the 1994 Rwandan genocide who took refuge at the Grand Mosque of Kigali and the Imams who opened their doors to give refuge to the Tutsi and to those Hutu who refused to participate in the killing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-6630"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>World Cinema</strong></span></p>
<p>A vibrant, esoteric sampling of some of the finest cinema the world has to offer.</p>
<p><em><strong>13 Assassins</strong></em> (Takashi Miike / Japan)<br />
Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer) has more than 80 films under his belt, but none quite like “13 Assassins.” The year is 1844, and a young lord reigns over his village with an iron fist. The era of the samurai is coming to a close, but one honest government official secretly enlists thirteen swordsmen to bring an end to the sadistic lord’s power before it spreads. While reverently paying homage to samurai classics of the past, this is not a tongue-in-cheek take on an old genre.  This is good old-fashioned film-making, with a gloriously blood-soaked climactic battle scene that will be remembered for years to come. <em>Starring Koji Yakusho, Takayuki Yamada, Yusuke Iseya and Goro Inagaki.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Arbor</strong></em> (Clio Barnard / United Kingdom)<br />
Clio Barnard’s debut feature is, at its core, a documentary about the life of British playwright Andrea Dunbar, whose writings chronicled her grim years living in West Yorkshire.  However, Barnard &#8211; by blending archival material about her subject’s life with the staging of the titular play &#8211; creates a beautiful blend of fact and fiction, earning her a British Academy Award nomination for Best New Director and six British Independent Film Award nominations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Buck</strong></em> (Cindy Meehl / USA)<br />
Audience Award-winner for Best Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival, “Buck” follows living legend Buck Brannaman – the inspiration for “The Horse Whisperer.” To this true cowboy, horses are a mirror into the human soul.  By teaching people to communicate with their animals through instinct, not punishment or violence, he frees the spirit of the horse and its human comrade. First-time director Cindy Meehl creates a strikingly cinematic portrait of a man who transforms his clients’ souls.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bhutto</strong></em> (Duane Baughman, Johnny O’Hara / USA, Pakistan)<br />
Pakistan’s first democratically-elected prime minister’s daughter, Benazir Bhutto, challenged Muslim views of women as authority figures when she returned to her homeland in 2007, hoping to run for office and reassert the power of free elections after decades of military dictatorship.  Her assassination in December of that year brought that dream to an end.  Bhutto is a film about  the history of Pakistani politics, the role of her family in the nation’s independence, and the controversies that surrounded her. It is a complete portrait of a compelling woman leader. Free screening as part of ITVS Community Cinema Nashville.</p>
<p><em><strong>Caterpillar </strong></em>(Kôji Wakamatsu / Japan)<br />
During the second Sino-Japanese War, a village woman is given the grueling task of looking after (and fulfilling the sexual needs of) her quadruple-amputee husband- a decorated soldier tortured by memories of his war crimes.  Based on a short story by Edogawa Rampo, Koji Wakamatsu&#8217;s film is a fascinating, deeply affecting indictment of right-wing militarist-nationalism, which is a partner-piece to his previous work, the left-wing extremism portrayed in “United Red Army.” <strong>Starring  Shinobu Terajima, Keigo Kasuya, Emi Masuda and Sabu Kawahara.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Human Resources Manager</strong> </em>(Eran Riklis / Israel)<br />
When the well-meaning but selfish human resources manager at Israel’s largest bakery finds his career threatened upon the death of a young immigrant employee, he takes it upon himself to escort her corpse back to her small Russian village.  Along the way, he meets characters – both helpful and not – who remind him of where humanity truly lies.  This quirky tragicomedy from director Eran Riklis (“The Lemon Tree”) was the Israeli submission to the Academy Awards.  Presented by the Nashville Jewish Film Festival. <em>Starring Mark Ivanir and Gila Almagor.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>My Joy</strong></em> (Sergei Loznitsa / Ukraine)<br />
When a kind-hearted trucker turns onto a dirt road to bypass a highway auto accident, he encounters a motley crew of characters – an old hitchhiker, a young prostitute, and a pair of rowdy soldiers – who will darken his worldview. Disturbing, outlandish, occasionally hilarious, and always a little dangerous, Sergei Loznitsa’s harsh depiction of the Russian hinterland is the rare debut feature to be selected for competition at the Cannes Film Festival. <em>Starring Viktor Memets, Olga Shuvalova and Vladimir Golovin.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Nénette</strong> </em>(Nicolas Philibert / France)<br />
Nénette is a 40-year-old orangutan born in Borneo and raised in the Paris Zoo that is her home to this day. She’s raised four children (one still lives with her in her habitat); outlived three mates; and bonds with very few of her keepers.  Nénette is also the star of a beautifully-composed documentary from the director of 2003’s “To Be and to Have.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Le Quattro Volte</strong></em> (The Four Times) (Michelangelo Frammartino / Italy)<br />
Inspired by Pythagoras&#8217;s belief in four-fold transmigration &#8211; by which the soul is passed from human to animal to vegetable to mineral  &#8212; Michelangelo Frammartino&#8217;s wondrous docu-essay traces the four cycles through the daily rituals of the inhabitants of a small village in the Calabria region of Italy.  Although it sounds overly-philosophical, “Le Quattro Volte” is a winner (literally taking home a prize in the Cannes Director’s Fortnight) because it approaches its subject with a sense of adventure and a surprising wit.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Red Chapel</strong></em> (Mads Brügger / Denmark)<br />
Winner of the World Cinema Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, Mads Brügger&#8217;s documentary follows a trio of Danish comedians as they pretend to be regime of sympathizers and mount an absurd variety show in North Korea. Combining the muckraking spirit of Michael Moore with the confrontational comedy of “Borat,” “The Red Chapel” is an unconventional, hilarious and damning peek behind the curtain of a totalitarian regime.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Robber</strong></em> (Benjamin Heisenberg / Austria )<br />
Based on the true story of Johann Rettenberger- a champion marathoner, “The Robber” is part action film and part fascinating character study.  Rettenberger leads a double life by winning international medals by day, and serially robbing banks by night.  Lean and visceral, “The Robber” is a riveting study of pathological compulsion featuring a sizzling lead performance by Andreas Lust (of the 2009 Academy Award-nominee, “Revanche”). <em>Starring Andreas Lust.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Sleeping Beauty</strong></em> (Catherine Breillat / France)<br />
Following last year’s “Blue Beard,” Catherine Breillat returns with another fractured take on a classic fairy tale with “The Sleeping Beauty.”  A young princess finds herself the subject of a tug-of-war among witches, but as the story ensues, Breillat uses fantasy (in every sense of the word – dark, sensual, sexual, and foreboding) to create a beguiling tale of girls in trouble who find their way, through imagination, and sheer force of will. <em>Starring Carla Besnainou. Julia Artamonov, Kerian Mayan and David Chausse.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, After Christmas</strong> (Radu Muntean / Romania)<br />
Selected for Cannes and the New York Film Festival, “Tuesday, After Christmas” is yet another shining example of the Romanian new wave. Paul loves two women. Adriana his wife and mother of their daughter- who is the woman with whom he&#8217;s shared the thrills of the past ten years; and Raluca the woman who has made him redefine himself.  He has to leave one of them before Christmas. In some hands this would be the stuff of slapstick and mayhem.  In the hands of Muntean and his pitch-perfect cast, it’s a moving portrayal of the directions modern life takes us. <em>Starring Dragos Bucur, Maria Popistasu and Mimi Branescu.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</strong></em> (Apichatpong Weerasethakul / Thailand)<br />
Uncle Boonmee is dying of kidney failure and wants to spend his final days on his farm.  He is joined not only by living relatives who will care for him, but also by his late wife, lost son, and other visitors from the spirit world.  But this is no monster movie.  Winner of the 2010 Palme D’Or at Cannes, “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives” is a natural, free-wheeling, pensive, and dryly funny film based on Buddhist belief, cinematic history, and the folk legends from the northern region of Thailand that was the boyhood home of director Weerasethakul.  Shot entirely on film (a rarity these days), “Uncle Boonmee” is a visual masterpiece not to be missed. <em>Starring Sakda Kaewbuadee, Matthieu Ly and Thanapat Saisaymar.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>!Women Art Revolution</strong></em> (Directed by Lynn Hershman-Leeson / USA)<br />
It was only a generation ago that it was rare to find works of art by women in a major gallery or museum. Director Lynn Hershman-Leeson was a proud participant in the revolution that changed that terrain, and thankfully, she spent the past forty years documenting and interviewing the vibrant women who changed our artistic culture and questioned art, politics, equality and freedom of expression.<em>Starring Yoko Ono, B. Ruby Rich, Miriam Schapiro and Yvonne Rainer.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Narrative Competition presented by Bridgestone</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Dog Sweat</strong></em> (Hossein Keshavarz/ Iran).<br />
Shot clandestinely in Tehran in the months leading up to the 2009 elections and the Green Wave that followed, “Dog Sweat” follows the lives of six young Iranians  &#8211; a gay male, a female pop singer, a feminist, a grief-stricken son, and two young lovers.  Filled with portraits of individuals both misunderstood by their families, and oppressed by the conservative Islamic regime, “Dog Sweat” provides a portrait of a new generations of Iranians. TENNESSEE PREMIERE.</p>
<p><em><strong>Domain </strong></em>(Patric Chiha, France)<br />
Named by John Waters as his favorite film of 2010, Patric Chiha’s elliptical and teasing tale of an unusual family relationship.  Pierre is a shy good-looking lad who has a decent relationship with his mother.  But, as he becomes aware of his homosexuality, he grows close to his free-wheeling, heavy-drinking aunt Nadia (French legend Beatrice Dalle). SOUTHEAST PREMIERE.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kinyarwanda</strong></em> (Alrick Brown, Rwanda / USA)<br />
KINYARWANDA interweaves six different tales (of a Tutsi/Hutu couple, a small child, a soldier, a pair of teenage lovebirds, a priest, and an Imam) that together form one grand narrative providing the most complex and real depiction yet presented of human resilience and life during the Rwandan genocide.  Kinyarwanda plumbs the shades of gray to find humanity in every perspective and offers a rich understanding of what it means to survive unimaginable terror, and the astounding resilience of the human spirit to find ways to heal and forgive. TENNESSEE PREMIERE.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Last Ride</strong></em> (Harry Thomason, USA)<br />
Inspired by the mysterious final days of Hank Williams’ mercurial life, “The Last Ride” is a look into the final days of country music legend, Hank Williams, and his relationship with the young man hired to drive the troubled star and his Cadillac from Alabama to Ohio in the dead of winter, around New Year&#8217;s Eve, 1952.  Sparse and contemplative, the story takes us inside the heart of a man who knows he’s dying, and a dreamless boy whose fate seems already determined. And yet, the all too human connection of two souls needing just one friend leave us with an ending of hope, optimism, and ultimately, redemption on one man’s last ride into eternity. WORLD PREMIERE.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Last Summer of La Boyita</strong></em> (Julia Solomonoff, Argentina)<br />
Young Jorgelina feels estranged from her boy-crazy older sister, who has entered adolescence and doesn&#8217;t want to hang around with little kids anymore.

SOUTHEAST PREMIERE.</p>

A plumber is called. That man, Red &#8216;Rooster&#8217; Rippington, shares his bed with a pretty, vaguely underage girl named Savannah. He also turns out to be a figure from Cornelius and Amos&#8217;s past. It will take the efforts of a mysterious drifter, Jackson, to smother the Rawlings Brothers&#8217; demons once and for all. TENNESSEE PREMIERE.</p>
<p><em><strong>Summer of Goliath</strong></em> (Nicolás Pereda, Mexico, Canada)<br />
Shocked by her husband’s sudden departure, Teresa embarks on a mission to find out what happened. Instead of finding answers, her mission becomes a journey through the streets and homes of the people she meets. Blending fiction and documentary, her wanderings portray the town and its inhabitants.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Documentary Competition Presented by Documentary Channel</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>An African Election</strong></em> (Jarreth Merz / Ghana , USA)<br />
The 2008 presidential elections in Ghana, serve as a backdrop for this behind-the-scenes look at the complex, political machinery of a third world democracy struggling to legitimize itself to its first world contemporaries. At stake in this race are the fates of two political parties that will do almost anything to win. Director Merz follows the key players for months to provide an unprecedented view of the political, economic and social forces at work in Ghana, and takes strides in answering the question – will democracy work in Africa?</p>
<p><em><strong>Autumn Gold </strong></em>(Jan Tenhaven / Austria)<br />
“Autumn Gold” tells the life-affirming stories of five senior athletes  &#8211; all between the ages of 80 and 100 &#8211; from across Europe who all share one goal: to take part in the 2009 track and field World Masters Championships in Lahti, Finland. Each is in a race against time and the natural degradation of their bodies – but each possesses a drive beyond age to achieve their goals of reaching the medal podium.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Big Uneasy</strong></em> (Harry Shearer / USA)<br />
Actor, humorist and New Orleans resident, Harry Shearer, (“This Is Spinal Tap,” “A Mighty Wind”) gets the inside story of a disaster that could have been prevented from the people who were there. You meet the investigators who poked through the muck as the water receded, and a whistle-blower from the Army Corps of Engineers. They reveal that some of the same flawed methods responsible for the catastrophic levee failures during Katrina are being used to rebuild the system and are expected to protect New Orleans from future peril. Harry Shearer will attend.</p>
<p><em><strong>Connected: An Autobiography about Love, Death and Technology</strong></em> (Tiffany Shlain / USA)<br />
Tiffany Shlain’s vibrant and insightful documentary, “Connected,”  explores the visible and invisible connections linking major issues of our time such as—the environment, consumption, population growth, technology, human rights, and the global economy— all while searching for her place in the world during a transformative time in her life. Employing a splendidly imaginative combination of animation and archival footage, plus several surprises, Shlain constructs a chronological tour of Western modernization through the work of her late father, Leonard Shlain, a brain surgeon and best-selling author of Art and Physics and The Alphabet Versus the Goddess.</p>
<p><em><strong>If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front</strong></em> (Marshall Curry / USA)<br />
Focusing on Oregon-based activist Daniel McGowan, Curry presents the tale of a mild-mannered, middle-class citizen driven to extremes and brought to trial on charges of terrorism for his participation in ELF-related arson plots. Detailing activists’ past disillusionment with public protest, and the police brutality and inertia that often followed, `the film poses difficult questions about the possibility of effecting change from either within or without the system, and examines the changed stakes for revolutionaries today in a world fixated on branding all dissenters as terrorists.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Interrupters</strong></em> (Steve James / USA)<br />
Meet the Interrupters—former gang members who disrupt violence in their neighborhoods as it happens. Acclaimed director Steve James (“Hoop Dreams,” “Stevie”) recounts the gripping stories of men and women who, with bravado, humility, and humor, strive to protect their communities from the brutality they once employed. With his signature style, James follows these individuals over the course of a year as they attempt to intervene in disputes before they turn violent:  two brothers who threaten to shoot each other, an angry teenage girl who just came home from prison, and a young man on a warpath of revenge. Both a voyage into the stubborn persistence of bloodshed in our cities today and a beacon of light, James’s unforgettable documentary captures each Interrupter’s inspired work, transporting us on a powerful journey from crime, to trust, to redemption.</p>
<p><em><strong>Just Like Us</strong></em> (Ahmed Ahmed / USA)<br />
Is there comedy in the Middle East? Despite there being no easy way to describe stand-up comedy in Arabic, a group of &#8220;comedy ambassadors&#8221; travel from Dubai to Beirut, Riyadh to Cairo with a double mission: to disrupt the pervasive image of Muslims as solemn, threatening, and inhuman, and deliver some much-needed relief and laughter to the intense reality of everyday life in the Middle East. As thoughtful as it is entertaining, the Egyptian-American comic’s directorial debut, “Just like Us,” shows us the Middle East like most Americans have never seen it before. Featuring the talented antics of Maz Jobrani, Tom Papa, Ted Alexandro, Tommy Davidson, Omid Djalili (“The Infidel”), Whitney Cummings, and Ahmed Ahmed himself, this documentary offers an incredibly timely glimpse into a world the West is only beginning to understand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Most Valuable Players</strong></em> (Matthew D. Kallis / USA)<br />
As budget cuts eviscerate various art programs in America’s schools, theater departments struggle to put on the school musical hoping for some attention of their own.  It&#8217;s no different in Lehigh Valley, PA, except for the &#8216;Freddy Awards&#8217;-  a live television event that recognizes excellence in local high school musical theater.  Illustrating that arts education encourages the same teamwork, camaraderie, and confidence as sports, “Most Valuable Players” follows three theater troupes on their creative journey to the elaborate award ceremony &#8211; the &#8216;Super Bowl&#8217; of high school musical theater. The film reminds us why the performing arts remain vital in the lives of young people. In the face of shrinking budgets, schools, parents, and communities must band together to preserve and nurture arts education.</p>
<p><em><strong>One Lucky Elephant</strong></em> (Lisa Leeman / USA)<br />
Nine years in the making, “One Lucky Elephant” follows the poignant journey of circus producer David Balding as he tries to find a nurturing and permanent home for Flora, the 18-year-old African elephant that he rescued as an infant, raised as his &#8220;daughter&#8221; and made the star of his circus. David&#8217;s love for Flora is put to the ultimate test when he realizes he made a terrible mistake keeping her as a solo elephant.  Knowing Flora will outlive him, David sets off on a quest to find a home where Flora can live freely with other elephants.  “One Lucky Elephant” raises vital questions regarding mans’ relationship to, and love for, wild animals.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Sons of Tennessee Williams </strong></em>(Tim Wolff / USA)<br />
“The Sons of Tennessee Williams” tells the story of the gay men of New Orleans who created a vast and fantastic culture of wildly popular &#8216;drag balls&#8217; starting in the late 1950s. These men worked with the traditions of Mardi Gras to bring gay culture into public settings in the early 1960s.  By the 1969 Stonewall Riots, there were four gay Mardi Gras clubs legally chartered by the state of Louisiana, throwing yearly extravaganzas at civic venues around the city and bringing down the laws that targeted gay people during this period. They staged a flamboyant, costumed revolution without politics, and won freedoms during a time, as now, when laws and people fought against them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New Directors Competition</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Aardvark</strong></em> (Kitao Sakurai / USA, Argentina)<br />
“Aardvark” is perhaps the first narrative film to star a man who has been blind since birth. In a role inspired by his own life, Larry Lewis plays a solitary man recovering from alcoholism and working towards stability.
