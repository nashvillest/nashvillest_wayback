Or do they have exceptions which Taco Mamacita is seeking?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Why would clergy be affected by any action at a public school?  Not that it would surprise me, but please tell me that my tax dollars have not been paying for religious &quot;guidance&quot; in public schools.]]></description>
