		<description>&quot;Only 164 days until next season!&quot;&lt;br&gt;I like your thinking. Our Preds did better than most expected. &lt;br&gt;I&#039;m proud of all us fans who were at the Barn last night cheering them on.  &lt;br&gt;Thanks Preds for another great season - see you in September for pre-season!</description>
