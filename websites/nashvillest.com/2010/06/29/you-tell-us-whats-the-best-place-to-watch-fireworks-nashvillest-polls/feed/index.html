		<description>That is lame as shit. Being downtown is what makes the fireworks special. Being a part of something where all of Nashville is jus partyin together is what 4th of July means to most people. Celebrating the birthday of this country as a CITY. fuck williamson county. We are nashville.</description>

		<description>Our church is having a block party! The fun begins at 6:00 pm with live music, inflatable games for kids, concession style foods, etc. At dark, we gather and have a great view of the Nashville firework show. Bring lawn chairs, your family and friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details:&lt;br&gt;First Church of the Nazarene&lt;br&gt;510 Woodland St.&lt;br&gt;Nashville&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nfcn.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.nfcn.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is across from the river so we have a great view and then you can jump on the interstate at Spring Street pretty quickly or take Gallatin to Briley</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve always liked sitting on the hill behind the Belmont Parking Garage (I think the street is Bernard Ave). In the past there have always been speakers blaring the Symphony music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s a good way to avoid the crowds too!</description>
