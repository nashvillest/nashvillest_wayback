		<description>This site is amazing.  During the first 48hrs, my wife and I were dry but trapped on the &quot;island&quot; of our part of Bellevue (Poplar Creek Rd). Our saving grace were our DROIDS, a car charger, and the Nashvillest Twitter feed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Been working in River Walk since Tuesday.  So many homes there are affected but out of the spotlight.  Don&#039;t forget about this tragedy come Monday when schools repoen!  So many people need help in many aspects of their lives right now.</description>

		<description>Just a quick thank-you for keeping this site updated with information - I live in Minneapolis, grew up in Nashville, and happened to be home during the flood.  It&#039;s hard to be unable to pitch in and physically help, but I really appreciate having a good source of information.  Your Twitter feed was invaluable as things were unfolding.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the update. It&#039;s really strange that with all the news stories about everything else (and piranhas!), I haven&#039;t been able to find a real update on the status.</description>
