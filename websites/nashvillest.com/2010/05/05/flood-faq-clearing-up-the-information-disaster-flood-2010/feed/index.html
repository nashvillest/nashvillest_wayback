		<description>I saw on one website where a photo restoration company is coming to town in a week or two to help with restoring flood-damaged photos, but now I can&#039;t find the link again.  Do you know anything about this?  My daughter had some college sorority photos damaged and it broke her heart.</description>

		<description>Is there any confirmed information available about the level of contamination the Harpeth River would have had when it was flooding Bellevue?   Did anyone take (and since analzyed) samples of the water for bacteria count?  Was the entire contents of the Williamson County sewage treatment plant in it, or were they able to contain that?   People are coming up here and telling people to rip out their siding and subfloors and whole duct systems because &quot;you just don&#039;t know what was in that water!&quot; and I want to know what the (relative) risk really is.</description>

		<description>Operation Photo Rescue  is gearing up to help those with damaged photos. We are a non-profit organizatione with over 2,000 volunteers in all 50 states and 49 countries. Since 2006 after Hurricane Katrina, we have restored over 6,000 photos. We do a digital copy (cameras on tripod) and upload to PhotoShelter where volunteers are able to pick a photo to restore and return. Once all of the photos are done, they are printed and shipped free of charge by DigMyPics back to the family. The most important thing right now is the care of the damaged photos. Here is a link for that information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.operationphotorescue.org/forum/index.php/topic%2C2739.msg25510/topicseen.html#new&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.operationphotorescue.org/forum/index...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.operationphotorescue.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.operationphotorescue.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the right hand corner is video shot by Jim Gagne of The Weather Channel of our Galveston, TX  rescue after Hurricane Ike. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Margie Hayes&lt;br&gt;President of Operation Photo Rescue&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mhayes@operationphotorescue.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mhayes@operationphotorescue.org&lt;/a&gt;</description>

		<description>NashvilleCitizen: You talk about whiners and it sounds like you are one of those. What are YOU doing to help??? Get off your computer and lend a hand instead of whining about who isn&#039;t out there helping! Attitude is everything and makes a huge difference in how people or communities get back on their feet. I am from Wisconsin and considering offering help instead of putting the responsibility on &quot;celebrities&quot;. Where the heck is your brain?</description>

		<description>Are you really a Nashville citizen? There&#039;s a fundraiser on right now with all kinds of local celbrities. It&#039;s been discussed on local tv for days. Were you not aware of it? Didn&#039;t you hear the coverage of the Titan who helped because he was physically able to? Now there are all kinds of local celebrities contributing time and money. You mentioned Taylor Swift - she donated $400,000. I think that&#039;s significant. Young Buck is there answering the phone. Nashville celebrities have done everything from getting in the middle of the mud and moving dirty furniture with the rest of people to singing and talking and donating big money because they can. You are all about the talk. What have you done? Our family has donated money.</description>
