		<description><![CDATA[Refers to the Gaylord Opryland Hotel, not the old Opryland theme park. The gayload is/was a gorgeous mutlimillion dollar hotel centered around a glassed in atrium that was in effect a huge indoor garden. My family went there 2 years ago when we were in town for a wedding. The hotel had to evacuate 1500 guests. The OpryMills mall next door is likewise severely flooded I believe. I wonder whats going to happen to all the people who work in both places...]]></description>
