		<description>I want to give a little plug / shout out for Magdalene/Thistle Farms, a local nonprofit who are in the running to win $1 of all tickets sold to the Nashville show!  Magdalene is a 2 year residential community for women who have survived lives of addiction, abuse and prostitution.  Thistle Farms is the nonprofit business run by the women of Magdalene, who hand make bath and body products.... and all proceeds of sales go back into the program!  More info can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thistlefarms.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.thistlefarms.org&lt;/a&gt; and you can vote directly for them to win Lilith  &quot;Choose Your Charity&quot; contest by going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/lilithfairtour?v=app_113475738667907&amp;ref=ts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/lilithfairtour?v=app_11...&lt;/a&gt;.  Thanks for your support, Nashville!</description>
