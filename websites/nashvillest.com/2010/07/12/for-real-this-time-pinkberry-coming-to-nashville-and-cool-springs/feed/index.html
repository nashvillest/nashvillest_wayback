		<description>It will also be interesting to see how Pinkberry does competing with other local fro-yo concepts.  California has at least 20 well known, quality frozen yogurt concepts in addition to the well known Pinkberry and Red Mango.  Interestingly enough,  people in retail and commercial real estate that I&#039;ve spoken with have all said the fro-yo concepts that are &quot;self serve&quot; are wiping the floor with Pinkberry&#039;s &quot;we serve you&quot; model these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think Pinkberry’s product is infinitely better than Tasti d-lite, regardless of serving method.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of the day, how many differences are there really when comparing a dozen frozen yogurt chains.  It’s nice being able to only buy $2 worth of fro-yo or put as much Cap&#039;n Crunch in the cup as I like.  Pinkberry doesn’t offer that ability, while Sweet Cece’s and Yogurt World Café do.  Brands who are empowering the consumer with control and choice over what they buy seem to be rising in popularity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Menchie’s has the brand, design, product and method of service nailed down.  Everytime I pass the Menchie’s on Nolensville, the place is slammed and they’re printing money.  My only complaints are they no longer offer mochi as a topping and that they sell so much fro-yo, sometimes it hasn’t frozen all the way when dispensed.</description>

		<description>Have you been to Krave? I find it to be the most similar (both atmosphere and taste) that Nashville has to Pinkberry. It will be nice to have the real deal though!</description>

		<description>Pinkberry is 10 times better than anything in Nashville, and yes...that includes Sweet CeCe&#039;s. But of course...If you prefer kiddy colors on the walls and cereal, by all means, stick with it...But...If you prefer better taste from a sleek sophisticated brand, then there is really no other choice than Pinkberry. I cannot beleive it&#039;s finally coming to Middle TN. About time.</description>

		<description>Krave (thanks for the spelling reminder) DOES take cards now.  Now you can use your credit card of choice and eat some frozen yogurt while feeling like you&#039;re in a Danish shoe store at the same time.</description>

		<description>We love Krave, but haven&#039;t been there in a while because they used to only take cash. Do you know if they take cards yet? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s also nice to pay by the ounce at CeCe&#039;s.</description>

		<description>Everyone&#039;s all about the Pinkberry and CeCe&#039;s.  Anyone out there eating Crave frozen yogurt in Green Hills?  It&#039;s the best of all of them.</description>
