		<description>My favorite thing about Nashville is being surrounded by good people who step up to help one another any time - not just times in need.</description>

		<description>There is so much to love about Nashville. I love the feel Nashville has of a small town in a large city. I love the different neighborhoods-from Belmont/12 South to East Nashville to Downtown to Franklin. I love the southern hospitality and warm faces of the people. I love the music scene and all the amazing talented friends/people I am surrounded by. But most of all, with the devastation that the flood brought, I love how this city all came together and served each other selflessly. Without the attention needed, we were still able to wow the nation and those who came to volunteer. It was because of this city and its people that we didn&#039;t turn into a Katrina. I &lt;3 Nashville</description>

		<description>I moved here last year from New York City, and I love this poster, and Nashville. I think my favorite thing here is having a yard. And trees! And just the color of summertime GREEN.</description>

		<description>Thanks so much Morgan! I&#039;m 9 months pregnant right now and experiencing anything other than a doctor&#039;s office or a grocery store has been a challenge, but I hope to in the near future.</description>
