		<description>Um, don&#039;t wanna be a hater here, but the Greyhound folks were told that they were not going to be moving until a permanent site was located.  They were not much more thrilled about the 11th and Charlotte site as those of us who live on the north end. It was obvious that the MCC folks orchestrated all this without letting hardly anyone in on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the supposedly permanent site failed to materialize, at least contractually, the Greyhound folks dug in their heels, just as they promised to those of us at the public meeting at Capital Hill Baptist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To characterize the Greyhound folks as the slow-pokes here, kinda misses a big part of the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, btw, i like the poster, even if Salemtown was left out.</description>
