		<description>It&#039;s also worth noting that the THP will be conducting several sobriety checkpoints over the weekend. You can find the location of all of the checkpoints here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.tennesseeanytime.org/node/5488&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://news.tennesseeanytime.org/node/5488&lt;/a&gt; (scroll down to the bottom; Nashville is district three).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don&#039;t forget city and county police will be doing their own sobriety checkpoints, too! :)</description>
