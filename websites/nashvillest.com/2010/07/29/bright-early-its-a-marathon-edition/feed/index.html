		<description>As far as I understand, the new immigration law wouldn&#039;t allow cops to stop anyone and ask for their papers just because they look illegal. The only way a cop could stop someone is if that person committed a crime. The cop would then be allowed to ask for proof of citizenship (kind of like when you get pulled over and have to provide a drivers license and proof of insurance).</description>

		<description>Well, we&#039;re certainly sorry to see you go! As a blogger, I don&#039;t claim complete objectivity. I aggregate the news, poke fun at both sides, and source each story so that folks can stay informed and draw their own conclusions. Especially in light of stories like Rep. Mike Turner&#039;s statement about convention center workers he has seen and suspected to be illegal, I believe it does raise an important question about the criteria used to determine that. How does someone simply look at a person and suspect that he or she does not possess certain papers? Apparently that&#039;s a legitimate enough concern that federal judges are hung up on it. When you&#039;re talking about a person&#039;s constitutional rights, I don&#039;t think you can ever tread too carefully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, I definitely respect your point of view and hope you&#039;re able to find a news source that&#039;s useful for you! :)</description>

		<description>OK, That&#039;s about all I can take. I&#039;ve subscribed to this blog&#039;s RSS feed since the flood, and the more I see, the more I realize how tilted towards the left it is. The comment above about &quot;check anyone&#039;s papers who looks illegal&quot; is just stupid. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re willfully misstating things or just ignorant. Either way, the usefulness of this blog is nil.</description>
