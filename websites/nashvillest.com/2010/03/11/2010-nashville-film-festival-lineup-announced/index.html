<p>It seems like just yesterday that we were straggling through the <a href="http://nashvillest.com/tag/naff09/"  target="_blank">2009 Nashville Film Festival</a> with over-ambitious schedules, obscene amounts of coffee and not nearly enough sleep. But it was almost a year ago, and it&#8217;s that time again &#8211; the 2010 Nashville Film Festival lineup has been announced, and we&#8217;re getting tired just looking at it. 70 Feature Films, 9 World Premieres and over 220 films from 38 countries make up this year&#8217;s offering. Impressive, yes?</p>
<p>Click through to read the full lineup press release. The 2010 Nashville Film Festival takes place April 15-22 at Regal Green Hills Cinema, and tickets go on sale April 5. For more information, visit them online at <a href="http://www.nashvillefilmfestival.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.nashvillefilmfestival.org']);" target="_blank">NashvilleFilmFestival.org</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em> The Southeast premiere of director Shane Dax Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Provinces of Night,&#8221; starring Kris Kristofferson, Val Kilmer, Dwight Yoakam, Hilary Duff and Reece Thompson, is one of the highlights of the more than 70 feature films &#8212; among them nine World Premieres &#8212; that will screen at the 2010 Nashville Film Festival (NaFF) as part of either the Special Presentation, World Cinema, Graveyard, Retrospective or four competition categories. Together with short films, more than 220 films from more than 38 countries will screen at the Festival, which takes place April 15-22 at the Regal Green Hills Cinemas.</em></p>
<div id="_mcePaste"><em>Major films screening in the World Cinema category include directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady&#8217;s &#8220;12th &amp; Delaware;&#8221; Reed Cowan &#8212; his film &#8220;The Other Side of Lens&#8221; World Premiered at NaFF 2009 &#8212; and Steven Greenstreet&#8217;s &#8220;8: The Mormon Proposition;&#8221; Catherine Breillat&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Beard;&#8221; Yorgos Lanthimos&#8217;s &#8220;Dogtooth;&#8221; David Morrissey&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Worry About Me;&#8221; Ben Wheatley&#8217;s &#8220;Down Terrace;&#8221; Joe O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s &#8220;Endure;&#8221; Chico Colvard&#8217;s &#8220;Family Affair;&#8221; Stanley Nelson&#8217;s &#8220;Freedom Riders,&#8221; Dagur Kári&#8217;s &#8220;The Good Heart;&#8221; Luca Guadagnino&#8217;s &#8220;I Am Love;&#8221; Jessica Hausner&#8217;s &#8220;Lourdes;&#8221; Marco Berger&#8217;s &#8220;Plan B; Mary Ann Smothers Bruni&#8217;s &#8220;Quest for Honor;&#8221; Steve James&#8217;s &#8220;No Crossover: Allen Iverson on Trial;&#8221; Nikolai Muellerschoen&#8217;s &#8220;The Red Baron;&#8221; Katerina Cizek and Peter Wintonick&#8217;s &#8220;Seeing is Believing;&#8221; Peter Liechti&#8217;s &#8220;The Sound of Insects: Record of a Mummy;&#8221; and David Kaplan&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8217;s Special.&#8221;</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"><em>James, in addition to bringing &#8220;No Crossover: Allen Iverson on Trial&#8221; to the Festival, will also present a retrospective screening of his groundbreaking documentary, &#8220;Hoop Dreams.&#8221;</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about the number of films we have from the UK this year, in addition to Italy, France, Greece, Austria and more,&#8221; said NaFF artistic director Brian Owens. &#8220;And to present a film from Iraqi Kurdistan in Nashville, which has the largest population of Kurds in the United States, is thrilling. Music film fans and documentary buffs will be extremely pleased with this year&#8217;s selections, stretching over a wide swath of subjects and styles, including, for the first time, several sports-related films.&#8221;</em></div>
<div><em><br />

<div id="_mcePaste"><em>Joining the previously announced Narrative Competition and First-Time Filmmakers Competition, a dozen films each, including a few to still be confirmed, will compete in the Documentary Competition and Music City/Music Films Competition.</em></div>

Having invented a brother whom they claim to have ostracized for his disobedience, the uber-controlling parents terrorize their offspring into submission. The father is the only family member who can leave the manicured lawns of their self-inflicted exile, earning their keep by managing a nearby factory, while the only outsider allowed on the premises is his colleague Christina, who is paid to relieve the son of his male urges. Tired of these dutiful acts of carnality, Christina enlists the elder daughter for some girl-on-girl action, carelessly disturbing the domestic balance. Soon enough, sex has spread throughout the household like fire. Next stop: rebellion.</p>
