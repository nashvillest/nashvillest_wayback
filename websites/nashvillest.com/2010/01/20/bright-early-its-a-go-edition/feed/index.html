		<description><![CDATA[After driving around in New Zealand a few years ago, I&#039;m all in favor of roundabouts (if not convention centers), but I hope they do this one right.  The one on Music Row has some serious problems:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) There are no signs leading up to it.  All of a sudden you&#039;re at a roundabout!&lt;br&gt;2)  What are the streets leading off of it?  They are not clearly marked as you approach, nor as you go around.&lt;br&gt;3) The roundabout is WIDE, but it&#039;s paved with brick, and there are no markings to make it clear whether it&#039;s a one-lane or two-lane roundabout.&lt;br&gt;4) There&#039;s a GIANT STATUE OF NAKED PEOPLE in the middle of it!  Tennesseans are not really used to this roundabout thing.  Please don&#039;t distract us with naked people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When done right, roundabouts are amazing.  You can drive all over the place without ever stopping at a light or stop sign.  I&#039;d love to see more of them in Nashville, but please do it right!]]></description>
