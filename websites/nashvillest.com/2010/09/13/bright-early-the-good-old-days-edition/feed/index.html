		<description>Thanks for the heads-up, Lillian! I looked for a news story this morning and couldn&#039;t find coverage other than WKRN which didn&#039;t seem to say anything new. I did post the volunteer link the other day and we&#039;ve dropped several links on Twitter. We&#039;ll try to keep a closer eye on thenashvillebuild.com.</description>

		<description>I am a little surprised you haven&#039;t mentioned anything about the Extreme Makeover build that is going on now! I have read on thenashvillebuild.com that they are still taking volunteers, and on their facebook page, they are posting updates and needs as they go. Thanks for keeping people up to date on all things Nashville - including this amazing build!</description>
