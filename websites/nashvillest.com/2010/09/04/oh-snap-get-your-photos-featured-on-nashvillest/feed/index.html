		<description>Cool. Glad to help if I can, which is not to say that it looks like you need my help. Group is great and one of my favorites to browse. Thanks for making this another great extension of the Nashvillest community.</description>

		<description>Thanks so much, Paul! :) It only took what, two years? We&#039;re some busy gals. And I&#039;ll let you know if I need some help moderating, which could very well happen in the near future.</description>

		<description>Wow. You finally got an icon for the group and everything! :-)

BTW: If you want help keeping the group cleaned up, I volunteer my services as a moderator. I admin 3 groups, moderate 2 others, and in general spend way too much time on Flickr already, so wouldn&#039;t be hard to do. Glad to help keep the spam cleaned up.</description>
