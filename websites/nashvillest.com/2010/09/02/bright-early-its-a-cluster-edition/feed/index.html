		<description>I totally forgot about the Cinderella concert at the Wildhorse. That&#039;s where the extra 30,000 must have been.</description>

		<description>Definitely not hating on Centennial! Just jealous of their ZOO ice rink. Ice skating amongst the flamingos has always been a dream of mine.</description>

		<description>I, for one, will be stocking up on bread and milk in case the road closures prevent me from getting to the grocery store.</description>

		<description>*Our* ice rink is in two different locations within the city, each with 2 sheets of ice.  Granted, it&#039;d be nice to have another sheet for the rec hockey leagues, but I have a feeling the Memphis Zoo rink won&#039;t be hosting many hockey games.

That said - go support Centennial Sportsplex and all the folks playing late on Sunday nights to get their hockey fix.  Better yet - go play!</description>

		<description>I keep hearing this hysterical 125,000 people figure thrown about in the media, but LP seats 68,978 and it won&#039;t be anywhere near full tonight, Bridgestone capacity for end stage concerts is about 18500 and the Ryman (uncomfortably) seats 2362. Hell, there&#039;s only two guys in Brooks and Dunn.

I can&#039;t see how there would be more than 80,000 total split between two sides of the river. Remain calm and use your turn signals.

Carry on.</description>
