		<description>yes, but.... it makes the mall/mall management look bad when i can guarantee it&#039;s not their decision. SPG is VERY corporate in the way it runs things. unfortunately opry mills is just the face of they way they (SPG) operate... anyway, doesn&#039;t matter to much to me because i know the behind-the-scenes stuff but just wanted to clarify for all those out there that are hating against opry mills and the staff.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s true that the Simon Property Group owns Opry Mills and is technically the one filing suit, but as the headline on the Tennessean story implies, they&#039;re suing on behalf of the mall. I figured it&#039;s less confusing than referencing the Simon Property Group since most folks aren&#039;t familiar.</description>
