		<description>Thrilled about the updates/upgrades to the bus system, specifically the access from smartphones. Of course they still need the info to work on basic WAP phones since most of their riding public uses those (if at all) as opposed to being smartphone users. Hopefully that&#039;s what is meant by &quot;smartphones or the MTA website&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also: Great that I&#039;ll be able to SMS to 911, but I don&#039;t think that would be as useful as SMSing 862-8600 for non-emergency police tips. The only text-a-tip service now is screwy and complicated. I should just  be able to SMS 862-8600 &quot;There&#039;s a guy selling crack at the Citgo on 8th. I am standing next to him filling up my car so I don&#039;t want to call you on the phone and tell you this where he can overhear me&quot; (not that that has ever happened to me. No way). Need to be able to txt those in.</description>
