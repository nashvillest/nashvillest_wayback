		<description>it isn&#039;t particularly advertised anywhere and may just be for weekday treks to the hall of fame, but when i visited last year my middle tennessee zip code got me a &quot;locals&quot; discounted admission.  not sure what the rules are, but it is worth asking about if you want to go but can&#039;t go this friday!</description>
