		<description>Headed up to St. Louis to do the every-other-year-with-her-family gig... hitting the sales on Friday.  Is it sad that I find Sears to have better sale items than any of the electronic stores?  I mean, wow, a front-loading, high-efficiency washer/dryer pair for 600 bucks??</description>

		<description>Since my family is in PA, my plan was to sit at my house, drink beer and eat chinese food. However, some other good friends just called saying they are in town, so it looks like friends together for Thanksgiving. That being said, i&#039;m still pushing for Chinese food.</description>
