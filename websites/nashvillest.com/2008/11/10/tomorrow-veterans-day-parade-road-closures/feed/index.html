		<description>The writer of the above blog is a pc moron. The parade is not a crazy parade as the sillly writer thinks. I bet the writer has never been to a vets day parade or went out of the way to thank a vet for his or her service. The parage is wonderful, sacred, interesting&lt;br&gt;display of patriotism toward the women and men of our military. Moron should delete the word crazy from above blog.  Siemper Fi!</description>
