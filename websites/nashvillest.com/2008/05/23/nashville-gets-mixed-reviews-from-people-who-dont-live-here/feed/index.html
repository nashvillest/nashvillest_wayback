		<description>Joyce - I tend to agree. But I&#039;m neither raising a family nor battling heart disease, and tend to appreciate the simpler things in life, which I guess is a big part of any person&#039;s quality of living. And I&#039;m  really jealous of the kayaking trip :)

Matt - An interesting perspective. I travel a lot, and haven&#039;t found Nashville&#039;s homeless population to be at all intrusive when compared to many other metropolitan cities. That&#039;s from a city dweller&#039;s perspective, though - many tourists may not think the same way.</description>

		<description>This city is wonderful. It just needs serious work.

As a small business owner that used to have a shop downtown I can clearly state that one of the biggest problems in Nashville is the homeless.

They drive business away, annoy the hell out of you, and make our city look bad.

Talk to anyone who comes here to visit downtown  and one of their first negative experiences is being hassled by the homeless.

The bigger problem stems from metro being unwilling to deal with them. I don&#039;t care how.</description>

		<description>I just came in after spending this glorious morning sitting on the porch drinking my coffee and reading the Tennessean. Later I&#039;m going hiking in Warner Park, and over the weekend I&#039;ll be kayaking the Harpeth. I don&#039;t care what anyone who doesn&#039;t live here has to say!</description>
