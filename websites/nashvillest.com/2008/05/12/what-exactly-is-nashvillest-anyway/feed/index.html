		<description>This site is great! Keep up the great work!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT you didn&#039;t know about the presidential candidates coming to town? As a Belmont student during the time of Debate &#039;08, I find that almost impossible to believe. It makes me die a little inside that you guys didn&#039;t know until after... mainly because it means you must not be paying attention to Belmont happenings at all. &quot;Debate &#039;08&quot; was printed on our parking permits, for crying out loud. Perhaps you need a BU contact keeping you in the know...</description>

		<description>There are plenty of dreadlocked folks here in Nashville, though it&#039;s probably not quite as big as it is in &quot;hip California.&quot; ;) You&#039;d probably love the feel of East Nashville... there&#039;s a pretty good description of it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/aug/24/in-east-nashville-hipsters-and-families-create-a/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/aug/24/in-eas...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
