		<description><![CDATA[@ag - Neither Portland Brew nor Ugly Mugs are seeing this as a problem. Jarod said that Portland Brew has been very accommodating and supportive, letting them use their space for meetings and helping them out wherever possible. 

I think that&#039;s pretty cool. Both the coffeeshops cater to a different crowd. For one, Ugly Mugs will be open on Sundays. That&#039;s a huge difference. And then you just have personal preference. I will probably never be able to discern why I prefer Bongo West to Fido, even though I live an equal distance from both. I just do. I think Ugly Mugs will find their niche and do just fine.]]></description>
