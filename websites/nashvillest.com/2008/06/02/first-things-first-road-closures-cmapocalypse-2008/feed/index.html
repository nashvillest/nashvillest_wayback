		<description>Erin, you&#039;ll notice that the release points out that roads will be closed through the 8th (last line) but only details the road closures through the 4th. Seems like it&#039;s missing a big chunk of the puzzle!</description>

		<description>First of all, it&#039;s just called CMA Music Festival, no fan fair. Also, what is your problem with the release? It&#039;s quite obvious which roads will be closed. Perhaps you should learn how to read.</description>
