		<description>Yeah, the problem with the fine is that they are targeting low wage poorly trained grocery store employees. I worked at Krogers, my friend got busted for this because it was apparently a fake ID. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need to take into account: &lt;br&gt;A. These workers see hundreds of IDs a day. &lt;br&gt;B. Krogers has the worst training program I have ever seen. I still don&#039;t know how to check a fake ID besides looking at the picture. Plus the pictures are usually terrible anyway. &lt;br&gt;C. Low wages = lower motivation. Plus the fact that $1,500 = 187 hours worth of wages fined (at starting wage of $8 an hour). For one mistake, that is pretty ridiculous.  These people also don&#039;t have the money to spare. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, there are people who are breaking the law and purposefully selling beer to minors. But this system needs to address these and other conditions that come into play where people already on a tight financial budget suffer for other people&#039;s crimes.</description>
