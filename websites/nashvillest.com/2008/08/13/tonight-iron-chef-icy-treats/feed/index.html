		<description>So glad you went to try paletas! They&#039;re probably in my top five favorite things about Nashville, in all honesty. I tried a corn paleta on Wednesday while we were watching the Throwdown and it was really good. Still have yet to try the pineapple chili paleta that won the competition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can&#039;t find anywhere to watch online, the Food Network doesn&#039;t even seem to recognize the fact that it aired. Their website says that the episode that aired last week was about Ice Cream. Strange.</description>

		<description>Went there on Saturday, after reading this. Wow, the corn popsicle really is amazing! My wife hated it, but she&#039;s not very adventurous with food. Is there anywhere to watch this episode? I don&#039;t have cable either :(</description>

		<description>@matt - I got a corn paleta. It was awesome. 

@Jamie - I noticed that as well when I looked it up, but it was definitely on last night. I won&#039;t spoil the ending for you, but I bet you can guess who won ;)</description>

		<description>I&#039;m confused. I looked up the episode listing on both food network and TV Guide and it listed the throw down on 8/13 as being against Izzy&#039;s Icecream Cafe in St. Paul????!!!</description>
