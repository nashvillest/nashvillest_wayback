		<description>Much obliged for the mention, ya&#039;ll. I&#039;m humbled that they&#039;d have me on their label, and I hope folks enjoy the record as much as I&#039;ve enjoyed making it. This all started out as a lark and kind of snowballed, I never expected a record deal out it. SL&#039;s the bleeding edge of a new-era of tech coming that will no doubt add a whole new dimension to how performing artists reach their fans and listeners around the world. Though SL is five years old, its in its infancy tech-wise, akin to where CompuServe was when the Mozilla browser came on the scene and change forever the world of online services. I&#039;m kind of ramblin&#039;, sorry, but I&#039;m thrilled to get signed, and appreciate the kind words above. :)</description>
