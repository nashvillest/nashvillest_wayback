		<description>Um, I think some of those Michiganers are staying on permanent vacation here. Do they calculate that? By the way, anytime I see a ranking I know its got to be better than my previous hometown of Birmingham (even if it&#039;s homeless rates or bad driving). Of course, rankings are cool if you&#039;re on top and bad if you&#039;re on the bottom, but otherwise do they really matter? On that note, I&#039;m gonna go treat myself to a haircut from Nashville&#039;s #7 ranked barber shop...</description>
