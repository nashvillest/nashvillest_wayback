		<description>[...] Remember back in July when we told you that Snoop Dogg was going to be remixing Johnny Cash&#8217;s &#8220;Walk The Line&#8221; for a Johnny Cash Remixed project? Well, the day has arrived. Sort of. The album comes out January 27, but thanks to a stroke of good luck, we can actually listen to good ol&#8217; Snoop&#8217;s track in its entirety RIGHT NOW.

		<description>Yeah, I disagree with the hatin&#039;. I was actually rather impressed with Snoop&#039;s country music video (better than current pop country), and honestly I think he remains &quot;real&quot; and isn&#039;t trying to make a quick buck like Bon Jovi, Faith Hill, etc.</description>
