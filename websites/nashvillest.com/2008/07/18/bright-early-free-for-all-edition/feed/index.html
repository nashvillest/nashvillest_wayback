		<description><![CDATA[@ Heather: You&#039;re right! We never seem to be fully conscious for the 9am post or something.

In the words of Channel 5: &quot;Early voting has got under way Friday for the Aug. 7 primary.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard early voting ends on 8/2 -- the primary itself is 8/7.

P.S. I love that photo. It&#039;s the vaguely creepy, hiding-in-the-bushes point of view that makes it for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Chris: From what I understand, the funding would be from private sources rather than public money. But then, their group is a non-profit so I&#039;d imagine public grants may come into play down the road. As far as money going to other counties, I don&#039;t see that happening. It&#039;s an interesting idea, for sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dean&#039;s idea is intriguing, but would it be paid for by county taxpayers?  Seems like something that would only sustain itself over the long-run with state funding and/or private-public financing.  If Knox, Davidson, Shelby, and Hamilton counties fund it, would it not be possible to have a scenario where Davidson tax dollars are being sent to other counties more than other counties tax dollars coming in.  If Davidson county has fewer potential community college attendees than these other counties, this would be a money swap from Davidson Co. taxpayers to Knox, Hamilton, etc. taxpayers.  Good idea?  Now if we benefit, then it is a good idea.]]></description>
