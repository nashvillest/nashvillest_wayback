Since your state appears to be rising relative to other states, the CDC shows you higher than CalorieLab does. If the 2007 data is not a 1-year aberation, and you really are getting fatter at a faster pace than other states, the CalorieLab rankings will reflect this in the next year or two.]]></description>
