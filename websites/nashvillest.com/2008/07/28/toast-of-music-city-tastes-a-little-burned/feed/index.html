		<description><![CDATA[I hate to push this whole thing along down a slippery slope,  *but* Nashville Scene writer Carrington Fox would just love to see Wild Ginger, Wildwood, and just about every stand alone place she has reviewed morph into chains growing like kudzu to satisfy her need to see these creative chefs be able to make a ton o&#039; money while spreading their vission of the fine dining experience. 

Of course many many moons ago, I betcha even Shoney&#039;s was respectable, thus spawning the chain in and of itself.

Stay tuned for the Loveless Cafe and Theme Park!  Ride the biscuit roller coaster!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, chaoin restaurant food is packaged food shipped in from thousands of miles away. There is less nutrition in it too. I wish more folks were into the whole local food movement, where you buy your produce from places that grow within 100 miles of your home..]]></description>
