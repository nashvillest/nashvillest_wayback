		<description><![CDATA[Tennessee has &quot;safe&quot; drivers because they all drive below the speed limit. Seriously, there are many times when hitting the gas pedal and gettin the hell out of a situation is the best way to go. And btw, no one here knows how to turn left at an intersection, you pull up so you can turn left when it goes yellow, completely legal and keeps the left lane moving. 

That being said, you want to see unsafe driving, try visiting New Jersey (I do not in any way ever recommend it). 

K, my rant is done.]]></description>
