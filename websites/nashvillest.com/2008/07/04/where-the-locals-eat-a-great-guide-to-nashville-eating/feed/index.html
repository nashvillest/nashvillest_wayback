		<description>This book came out about 6 months or a year after I moved to Nashville.  It has been really useful, even though a few new spots have opened up since its publication.  I&#039;d recommend it for anyone learning the areas, food neighborhoods, and dining options.</description>

		<description>My wife got me their book for Christmas. Very cool, especially if you&#039;re new to Nashville like we are. Helps you find those hidden gems that are usually a few blocks off the main drags.</description>
