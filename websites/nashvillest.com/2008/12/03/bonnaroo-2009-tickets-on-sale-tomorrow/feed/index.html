		<description>Good advice! I&#039;ve heard of a few people pulling shifts with security in return for free/discounted admission and seemed to still see a lot of the festival. Definitely something to consider.</description>

		<description>If you are planning to go I highly recommend volunteering.  It requires a flexible schedule a few days beforehand, but you get a great spot, free ticket, free meals, and free showers.  Nobody I know had a job that was anywhere near taxing or badly scheduled.  I ended up working the beer tent...it doesn&#039;t get any better than that!</description>
