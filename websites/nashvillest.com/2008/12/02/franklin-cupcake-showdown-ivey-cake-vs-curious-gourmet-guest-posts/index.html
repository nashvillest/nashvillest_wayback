<p><em>Our friend Allison Martin is one of our favorite Franklin readers, and she was kind enough to gorge herself on cupcakes for the purposes of this review. Allison makes quilts on commission at her website, <a href="http://threadsofhope.wordpress.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/http://threadsofhope.wordpress.com/');" target="_blank">Threads of Hope</a> - check it out!<br />
</em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Nashville isn&#8217;t the only city  to experience a sudden influx of cupcake shops. South of the border  in Franklin, we have our own tale of two cupcakeries: <a href="http://www.iveycake.com" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/http://www.iveycake.com');" target="_blank">Ivey Cake</a> and  <a href="http://curiousgourmetcupcakes.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/http://curiousgourmetcupcakes.com/');" target="_blank">Curious Gourmet</a>. What&#8217;s a Franklinite or visiting Nashvillian to do?  Do you visit Curious Gourmet, the cupcake café on Main Street with  a gorgeous kitchen appliance store (of the same name) next door? Or  do you venture down to 4<sup>th</sup> Street, just past the Mercantile  to the sweet, cupcake sized shop Ivey Cake? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Thankfully, I have a sweet  tooth and was ready to try out both! Curious Gourmet Cupcakes</span><a href="http://curiousgourmetcupcakes.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/http://curiousgourmetcupcakes.com/');" target="_blank"></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> was the first to arrive. Opening  first with as a cupcakery, the store features a variety of cupcake flavors  available daily like Devil&#8217;s Food, Dulche de Leche, Pretty Pretty Princess  (vanilla cupcake with pink buttercream icing), and Vanilla Bean. They  also have a list of over 20 cupcakes available on select days like Red  Velvet, Pumpkin, German Chocolate Cake, Key Lime Pie and many more!  Curious Gourmet also has breakfast cupcakes such as Banana Walnut, French  Toast, Pecan Sticky Bun, and Lemon Poppyseed. Their cupcakes are $3.25.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Their shop is larger than Ivey  Cake&#8217;s with tables to sit and enjoy your cupcake and a cup of their  coffee. They also have beautiful counters and cabinets and use all the  top appliances and kitchen tools which are sold at the Curious Gourmet  kitchen store a few shops down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Now, my rules about cake are  hard and fast: the cake has to be good enough to stand on its own while  the icing should be sweet, but not so sweet I can&#8217;t eat it all. I also  don&#8217;t want to buy something that I could make, so the cupcake needs  to taste original with a lingering flavor, not something I could make  from a box. My first cupcake at Curious Gourmet was Red Velvet: my favorite  cake. The cupcakes have as much icing as cake, so I was excited to take  a bite. However, I found the cake to be a bit dry and the icing to be  too sweet. I could only eat about half the icing. The taste was good,  but similar to icing I would taste on a store bought cake. The cake  was alright, but Duncan Hines&#8217; box cakes I make at home are better.  A few days later, I decided to give it another chance and bought the  Devil&#8217;s Food cake only to have a similar experience. I was very disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">About a month later, I noticed  Ivey Cake tucked next to Franklin Mercantile.  Ivey Cake is smaller, fun, creative, and very pink. If you want to sit  to eat your cupcake, you have to slip into the Mercantile (the stores  are connected). They aren&#8217;t open as often (mostly from 11-3), but they  also make amazing custom cakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">I talked with the owner, Ivey,  and shared my frustrations about Curious Gourmet. She encouraged me  to give her red velvet a try. Their cupcakes are $3.00 and the icing  about half to two-thirds as high as Curious Gourmet&#8217;s. The cupcakes  look like a beautiful version of what you might try to make yourself;  they lack the polished sheen of Curious Gourmet. They&#8217;re also named  things like Total Flake, Bad Kisser, Lucky in Love, The Rebel, and so  on. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect, but I was willing to try something  new. The red velvet cake, The Break-Up, was perfection! The cake was  moist and rich, the perfect combination of chocolate and vanilla flavors.  So good in fact that I even licked the delicious crumbs off the silver  wrapper! The cream cheese icing was rich but since it wasn&#8217;t too high,  it didn&#8217;t seem over-done. I&#8217;ve also tried The Rebel (German chocolate),  Bad Kisser (chocolate with chocolate icing), and most recently, Big  Dreams (strawberry with pink cream cheese icing). Not a single one has  let me down. Big Dreams even came to Ivey in her sleep after a frustrating  day of trying to find <em>the</em> perfect, most original recipe for strawberry  cake. Definitely not Duncan Hines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The only disappointment with  Ivey Cake was trying to go on a Monday, finding the store closed, thus  giving Curious Gourmet a third try with the Pretty Pretty Princess cupcake,  and being sorely disappointed yet again with dry cake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The final verdict: While Ivey  Cake may be open less and is much smaller, they take the cake with their  moist, memorable flavors and names, and absolutely delicious cupcakes!  Next time you come to Franklin, swing by Ivey Cake for dessert and check  it out yourself!</span></p>
