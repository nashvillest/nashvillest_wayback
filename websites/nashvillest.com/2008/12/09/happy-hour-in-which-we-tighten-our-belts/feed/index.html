		<description>What&#039;s the big deal? As long as Al&#039;s not drunk, I don&#039;t care if he drives a hundy. He&#039;s a pro athlete with commensurate strength and reflexes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously, as a serial speeder, I believe 100 is the new 50. At least I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; it to be so.</description>
