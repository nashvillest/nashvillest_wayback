		<description>What a weekend. I made it to college gameday on Saturday, and then got into the game with a last minute ticket. However, I have little to be proud of since I&#039;m an AU alum and proud fan. My team has more issues that Paris Hilton right now, though, so I guess I wasn&#039;t completely surprised that Vandy stepped up to win. Congrats to the Commodores. They&#039;re no longer the &quot;DORE-mats&quot; of the SEC. :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And at least the Titans won. These guys are good!!</description>
