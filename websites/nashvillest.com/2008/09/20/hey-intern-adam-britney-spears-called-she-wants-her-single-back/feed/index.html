		<description>Jenny, of course there are more important things to worry about. But if I screwed up at my job by releasing confidential information that landed my company a quarter mil in fines, you can bet I&#039;d be out of a job pretty quickly. There are parameters in every line of work and Adam unfortunately made a poor decision that cost him his job.</description>

		<description>I tink there are more important things to worry about than if Intern Adam played one of Britney&#039;s songs before he should have.  It will not hurt her.  She will not lose millions because people heard it early.  It might even help, her and she needs it.  I don&#039;t think the man should lose his job.  Ridiculous, Plus I like listening to him.</description>
