		<description>Yeah the CNN article was humorous to read this morning. It was the same where I work (Macauthority) - it wasn&#039;t that we heard we were running out of gas, it was that NO ONE COULD FIND ANY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh well. Thanks CNN, for letting us know why this happened.</description>
