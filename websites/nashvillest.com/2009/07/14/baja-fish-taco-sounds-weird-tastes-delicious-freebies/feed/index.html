		<description>Got one of these at lunch today. I probably never would have tried one if it wasn&#039;t free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In no way does it resemble what most people mean when they say &quot;fish taco,&quot; but it was still good. It&#039;s like a fish snacker sandwich but in a tortilla with fancied-up mayo. For 99 cents each, I can see working these into my regular lunch rotation.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ve never had fish tacos but from what all I hear about them I must be missing out. I&#039;d go by a Long John Silvers today, but I&#039;m destined for some delicious Bolton&#039;s Hot Chicken today. Soon fish tacos, soon.</description>

		<description>FWIW, Baja Burrito on Thompson has had fish tacos for years.  I&#039;m not a fan of fish tacos myself, but the people who like them say that theirs are great.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s also Fish Taco Tuesday at Chile Burrito. They&#039;re not giving them away for free, but they do give a discount, and what&#039;s more they&#039;re actually good!</description>
