		<description>I definitely saw one at when I was watching those people fight in Elmington Park last Sunday. But other than that, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen one in years!</description>

		<description>I am so excited that someone out there got it. ;) Those bumper stickers are just the first thing that pops into my head when I hear the phrase &quot;jet noise.&quot;</description>

		<description>I freely admit that guys in utilikilts automatically get sexy points in my book. I remember seeing those at Dragon*Con back in 2004 and thinking they looked awesome. Heck, I want one and I&#039;m a chick. :)</description>

		<description>I can&#039;t picture a &quot;hunter&quot; wearing a kilt! The men in TN who think they&#039;re macho would not be caught dead in a kilt. They obviously don&#039;t care about freedom of movement or they wouldn&#039;t wear Wranglers that are 7 sizes too small. They might go for a kilt that was made from camo though..</description>
