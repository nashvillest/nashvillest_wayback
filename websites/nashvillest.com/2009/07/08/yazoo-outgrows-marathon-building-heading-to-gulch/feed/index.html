		<description>In the Yazoo blog post, Linus says he&#039;s kicking around ideas for the current space. Pretty vague, but maybe we&#039;ll see a Yazoo presence there still.</description>

		<description>I think for now they&#039;re going to keep the current taproom hours, but they&#039;re open to expanding if the demand is there.</description>

		<description>It&#039;ll definitely put it in a better part of town, and in one more suitable to its clientele... but what will happen to their existing building at Marathon?  Maybe Lightning 100 can move into it and create a kickass studio and office in one place instead of having the office be down the hall from the studio (with a photo company in between).</description>

		<description>If the taproom is open normal bar hours and within walking distance of the rest of the Gulch, sounds like a win to me, for the city and for their business.</description>
