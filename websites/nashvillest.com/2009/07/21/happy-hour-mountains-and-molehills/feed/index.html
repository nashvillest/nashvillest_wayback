		<description>Your Tuesday smart ass comments from CeeElCee:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Re: W.O. Smith School...love what they&#039;re doing there, but did they really have to fly to D.C. to get advice from two folks who live in a suburb of Franklin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Re: Piggy Popcorn, I now know of at least three media outlets who got free samples of that stuff yesterday. Only the Thinnessean jumped to write a feature story on a snack food. Hell, I write for a food blog and even we didn&#039;t bite that quickly. Smells like desperation. And bacon. Mmmm...desperation.</description>
