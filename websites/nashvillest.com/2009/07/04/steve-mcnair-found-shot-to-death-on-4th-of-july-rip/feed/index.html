		<description>1 - I know that at least in my experience, people in my neighborhood were shooting off fireworks all night long on the 3rd/morning of the 4th. I was at a friend&#039;s house in East Nashville and they were making jokes along the lines of &quot;at least we know it&#039;s fireworks tonight and not gunshots.&quot; Due to the timing it&#039;s possible that they were heard but assumed to be fireworks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2 &amp; 3 - No idea other than the details that have already been released... to point #3 they have repeatedly said that McNair was not found to be in violation of the law and was allowed to leave, with not much else explained. I&#039;m not sure if he was omitted from the original report or if that information was just not conveyed to the press until later in the investigation.</description>

		<description>A few things i find weird (though no conspiracy theories here):&lt;br&gt;1) there were apparently at least 3 gunshots fired in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend in an apartment complex downtown and no one called anything in to the police? Dozens of people had to have heard the shots&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Along those lines, why did the dude that found the bodies call a common friend first, rather than the police or anyone else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Is it not normally policy for the police to record the names of passengers in a DUI case? Why did they omit McNair from the original report and just let him take a cab home?</description>
