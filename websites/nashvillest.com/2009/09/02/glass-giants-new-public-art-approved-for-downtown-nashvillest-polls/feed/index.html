		<description>Nashville&#039;s taste for &#039;cute&#039; public art continues unabated. Not a bad way to keep the city&#039;s provincialism intact.</description>

		<description>i haven&#039;t read the comments, so forgive me if someone has already said this.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i am all for nashville spending money for public art but my question is this:  why can&#039;t we spend that money to help fisk create a place to house and display their o&#039;keefe collection?  then we could let everyone with a middle tn address enter at a discounted rate---that would be some public art that i could get behind</description>

		<description>This is fugly.  We have this beautiful new park, renovated Art Deco courthouse, all the water features.  They all coexist wonderfully.  These one-armed &#039;thangs&#039; are embarrassing.  Why have arms on them at all?  Why do they have to have a pseudo-human form?   What a waste.  The arts-incentive program should produces THE BEST art in the city, and this is what we get?  How unimaginative. Fail.</description>

		<description>Two one-armed men asking for donations? Nashville is broke, right? I mean, that&#039;s all we hear/read anymore.&lt;br&gt;And what happens when the sun hits that glass at the top and someone gets the retina&#039;s burned out? Who do they sue, the artist or the city? Come on folks, tell me you didn&#039;t think of that too...&lt;br&gt;Ugly piece of NON-LOCAL (ugly) art...</description>

		<description>If the artist intended a football reference then the pointing things (arms?) should always point to the nearest senators, congressmans, or legislatiors offices because lately they all seem to be &quot;offsides&quot; or encroaching on our life, liberty, and pursuit of freedom...freedom to have a home, a good job, healthcare, etc.</description>
