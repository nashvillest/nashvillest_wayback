		<description>Serve and protect? The bike speed limit is the stupidest thing I&#039;ve seen this city waste time on in the 7 years I&#039;ve lived here.  Hello Metro, I would like to be protected from being mugged between my car and home in East Nash.  Could you work on that instead of wasting officers in our park.  A 15 mph limit is a joke on a bike.  Maybe people could be more alert and cut off the ipods and cell phones when walking and stay to the right like they&#039;re supposed to.  Or we could be responsible for our own lives.  Whatever self-entitled, overprotective, hypersensitive fools out there complained about the greenway traffic should be embarrassed with their trivial lives. Why don&#039;t you start a neighborhood watch and protect your lawnmowers with all your free time.  Wait! Maybe someone stole YOUR bike and you&#039;re still sore about it?  Jealously from all the happy bikers got to you?  Must be it.</description>
