		<description><![CDATA[Tim, I notice you like to wear Russ Limbaugh type ties. I also hear you in the mornings on 99.7 and you talk about your ties sometimes. I have several of his ties but do  not wear them . It would be my pleasure to give them to you if you would like to have them. They are good as new.. Gived me a call 945-0414, Jim]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shame on WSMV for letting the bright, colorful and bubbly Tim Ross leave the weather team. As an exclusive Channel 4 news viewer, I am very disappointed and would turn WSMV news off altogether if not for Dennis Ferrier&#039;s investigative reporting. Wonder what Dan would have said about the changes?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim Ross was a joy to watch in the mornings.  His bright personality added a lot to the newscasts.  Channel 4 made a mistake in letting him go.  The new guy (Josh Devine, I think) is okay, but his personality doesn&#039;t hold a candle to Mr. Tim&#039;s.  Maybe some other TV station in Nashville will snatch him up.  I hope so.]]></description>
