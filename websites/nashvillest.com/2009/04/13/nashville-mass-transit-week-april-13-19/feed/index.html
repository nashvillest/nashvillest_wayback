		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this comment, Paul. I love hearing from people who actually use the public transportation in this town... You are few and far between! Me, I wish I could take the bus, but since I work in Cool Springs it&#039;s not an option for the majority of my daily driving. Props to you for actually utilizing the bus system in Nashville, frustrating as it may be!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true, I tried riding it before, but due to the inane and under-developed routing it does literally add hours to your trip.  Furthermore, their online &quot;Trip Planner&quot; doesn&#039;t even work!  MTA will get users when they create an actually helpful system.  Until then they can have all of the awareness weeks they want.  All it will do is make people aware of how useless it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish i could take the bus to work again. I am one of the rare few that both lives and works near metro bus lines. Trouble is taking the bus adds more than an hour to my daily commute time. I loved taking the bus for a while (relaxing, time to read, etc) but it just takes too much valuable time out of my day :-(&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do recommend that people try it if they never have. The system in Nashville is an inefficient hub/spoke model (you have to take the bus in to downtown to transfer to another line), and the cost could be better, but the over all experience really isn&#039;t bad at all.]]></description>
