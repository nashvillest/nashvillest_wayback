		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s also going to be a free show at Bobbie&#039;s Dairy Dip on Charlotte featuring Danger &amp; The Steel Cut Oats, James Wallace &amp; The Naked Light, Row Craven, and Vermicious K&#039;Nids. I was at the one last year and it was a good time. Facebook says it starts at 6PM. Best of all, you won&#039;t have to try to park at Vanderbilt. Plus, ice cream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don&#039;t forget about the open casting call for the zombie movie in Smyrna. Zombie School is at 7AM. I think you guys have the details in another post.]]></description>
