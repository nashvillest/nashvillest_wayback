		<description><![CDATA[Is this what I&#039;ve been reading about in regards to making specific attendance goals of 14,000 average attendance. From what I&#039;ve read, we have met this and if that helps us get better revenue sharing for the team/arena I&#039;m all for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tonights game will be a big one, and I&#039;m hoping we hit that 17,113 (sell out capacity) attendance number and show our support. I know I&#039;ll be there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Preds actually *will* meet the threshold for full revenue sharing (it is a done deal, not a maybe). Basically it means that smaller market teams like Nashville get paid a bit of money from the mega-huge market teams (like Detroit, Toronto, etc) to help even the playing field financially, so the teams can be competitive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big news on tonight&#039;s game is that if we win, we GREATLY increase our chances of getting in the playoffs during this VERY tight race coming down to the end of the season. If we win and St Louis loses, our chance of getting in is very very good.]]></description>
