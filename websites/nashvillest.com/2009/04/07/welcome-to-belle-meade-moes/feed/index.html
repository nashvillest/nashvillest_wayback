		<description><![CDATA[The burrito scene has an interesting history here in Nashville. I&#039;m not sure who you are sh4wn, but I know one of the owners/partners of Chez Jose as well - his name was Marvin Morris. He and I were in the same class at MBA (Montgomery Bell Academy), graduated in &#039;84. Chez Jose was actually started out west somewhere, according to Marvin - he and some partners. I was sad to see Chez Jose close down - it was some very good food and the reason I love burritos today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there is Baja Burrito. Baja was truly created by Troy Smith, who went out to CA and did his research to create his now solidly entrenched restaurant in 100 Oaks. Troy was an FRA friend of another MBA classmate of mine during high school. I&#039;ve know him and his brother and sister for many years. I&#039;ve eaten Baja many times. Great food. Fun atmosphere. Troy and his dad have worked to franchise Baja Burrito as Blue Coast Burrito, and it appears to be going well, as there are several in the area, and some in Arkansas and possibly other locations now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next comes Chile Burrito - another MBA graduate Talbot Masten (1985 I believe). Talbot created his concept in St Louis (is that right Talbot?), where he owned (owns) some other establishments. He moved back here and brought his concept with him. He now runs 2 stores, one downtown and one in Brentwood. Talbot grills his burritos before rolling them. Very good that way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, there is me, and Moe&#039;s. I&#039;m the local owner of the 5 Moe&#039;s that are around Nashville. I wish I had created the concept, but I am trying to bring local ownership, and with that, care and concern for the community. I&#039;ve been here for 28 years, raising my family here, and employ over 100 people in the community, and give back thousands of dollars annually to support schools, sports teams, and other community efforts. I believe in good customer service, great food, and a warm, honest place to get a burrito that you can trust. I love my buddies places too, though. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#039;t know the owner of Qdoba - he is possibly from Indiana or KY, and has lots of Qdoba&#039;s in Louisville. Baja Fresh has 3 company owned stores here in Nashville and are looking to get out of them. Too bad - love their Baja Burrito. Chipotle is coming to town. I know some of you will rejoice in that, but they are the 500 lb corporately owned, gorilla. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I appreciate the discussion on food and atmosphere preferences herein. Glad to see so many burrito fans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moe&#039;s may be a chain, but we are not some corporately owned, uncaring, ungiving entity. I love getting to know folks in communities where I&#039;ve not spent much time. Murfreesboro, Spring Hill - good folks that remind me of where I grew up (McMinnville, TN) , and my father&#039;s home town (Huntingdon, TN). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, it seems, 85% of all burritos in Nashville lead back to 4 men who were in high school together in the mid 80&#039;s, 3 of which were at the same school. Strange but true. Only in Nashville. I guess that&#039;s another entry in the &quot;You are so Nashville if... you went to high school with someone who started a burrito chain.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scott Portis]]></description>
