		<description><![CDATA[I have to say, I&#039;m always amused at fan-voted restaurant reviews; I suppose nashville lifestyles readers are &quot;more likely&quot; to be foodies, but it&#039;s telling to me that so many of the restaurants are chains.  (That said, I work for PF Changs, and PFCB,Inc got 2 of the 3 chinese spots- go us.)  All three Steakhouses listed are chains (really? there isn&#039;t one great local steak place? that&#039;s a shame)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I tend to think that the professional critic&#039;s lists are better, because they have a more comprehensive experience with food and restaurants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and in your related posts: consider adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherethelocalseat.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.wherethelocalseat.com&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
