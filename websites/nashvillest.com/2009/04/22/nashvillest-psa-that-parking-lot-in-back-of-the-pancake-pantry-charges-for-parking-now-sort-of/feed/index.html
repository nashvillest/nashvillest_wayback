		<description><![CDATA[Last time I was at Jackson&#039;s a friend asked if they would get ticketed behind Pancake Pantry. I said no of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She got a ticket and I was an instant douchehat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is unfortunate but your stellar journalism is shining light on this issue and helping others not make similar mistakes. Thanks!]]></description>
