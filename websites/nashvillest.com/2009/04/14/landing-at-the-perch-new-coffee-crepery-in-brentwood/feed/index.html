		<description><![CDATA[I was traveling through Nashville a couple of months ago and stumbled onto the Perch the day they opened. AWESOME!!!! Even stopped on my return trip. Just sent info to a couple of friends who will be traveling by. My husband is French and makes crepes at home. I purchased some for him and several hours later....he loved them! We are from Charleston, SC and there nothing like it. Now living in Huntsville, AL and are planning to make a trip up just for crepes in the fall.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Went today. Loved it! The green apple and brie crepe was delicious, as was the black and white winter (I think that was the name of the drink).  I wouldn&#039;t call it cheap - a crepe and my small drink were about $10.50 - but it was well worth the money.  The guys working behind the counter were really friendly and helpful, the food was excellent and they didn&#039;t skimp on the filling for the crepe, and I like the fact that it&#039;s locally owned.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I went over the weekend. Also, they are incredibly nice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not the bad kind either. If you are a church-goer, sometimes at the entrance they have these people who smile way too big and you just want to get to the coffee. It wasn&#039;t like that. It was like they smiled sincerely then handed the coffee to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s small and only has one outlet for computers, so instead of a computer, I&#039;ll bring a friend next time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/theperchtn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/theperchtn&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
