		<description><![CDATA[Jermscentral, I was a zombie and I am not a hipster.  The set was full of goths, horror fans, zombie fans, and people who just wanted to have fun.  You would find the same type of people at a Ren. Fair or Star Trek convention.  Age has nothing to do with it, my dad and I both went. Quit slamming people for having fun and go out and have some of your own.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think the hipster fashion has anything to do with the whole zombie genre, though - I think for some reason that movie monster is just more accessible today than your traditional vampire/frankenstein/werewolf creatures. I don&#039;t see it as a fad - the fad that will fade away is the torture porn style movies (saw) that are so popular right now. Zombies have been around since the 30&#039;s (White Zombie, Bela Lugosi) and flourished ever since Romero&#039;s Night of the Living Dead. Zombies are here to stay, like em or love em.]]></description>
