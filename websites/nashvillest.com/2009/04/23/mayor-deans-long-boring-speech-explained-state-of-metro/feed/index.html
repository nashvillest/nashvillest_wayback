		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a political speech not a stand-up gig or a speech to keep you from living in a van down by the river. If you wanted to highlight the content then don&#039;t bury the lead behind the title of &quot;Mayor Dean&#039;s Long &amp; Boring Speech Explained.&quot;  I wasn&#039;t saying the post&#039;s content wasn&#039;t helpful, but that the title wasn&#039;t clever but rather unfortunately perpetuating today&#039;s ADD&#039;d &quot;entertain me&quot; culture.  Just a criticism, no harm meant.  I&#039;d say, &quot;hey, it&#039;s just Nashvillest,&quot; but to your very deserved credit you&#039;re getting quite the following, and with that comes a higher responsibility.]]></description>
