		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, i giggle like a school girl every time someone has said teabagging over the last week.  The bad part is they always want me to explain what is so darn funny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;@ &quot;Only if Fox News told them to do it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;You know this is getting really frightening, I have never had a &quot;news&quot; network make me scared before, but Fox news pulls it off.  Most of their recent stuff is just a few steps shy of &quot;take up arms and over throw the government.&quot;]]></description>
