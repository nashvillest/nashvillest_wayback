		<description><![CDATA[I love your blog and tweets, but I gotta take up for Q-Tip.  Q-Tip is much more than a &quot;producer for Nas and Mariah.&quot;  He was the leader of A Tribe Called Quest, one of the most influential hip hop groups of all time.  Their album &quot;Low End Theory&quot; was included in Rolling Stones Top 500 Rock Albums of All Time (admittedly, that list has some questionable entries).  I would encourage anyone, especially those who can&#039;t stand most hip hop today, to track back to some early Tribe albums and also check out Q-Tip this weekend.]]></description>
