		<description>Really pumped for Grimey&#039;s this weekend..been looking forward to it for a month or two now.  The past two outdoor sales they&#039;ve done I&#039;ve walked away with a band I hadn&#039;t heard of until that day that I loved and have kept up with afterwards, so I&#039;m sure there will be more of that come Saturday.</description>

		<description>Man, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to make it over there either. I&#039;d like to but between Grimey&#039;s, the film festival, Rites of Spring and Centennial&#039;s Earth Day, the thought of adding new stuff makes my brain scream in horror.</description>
