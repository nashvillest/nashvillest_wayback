		<description>I don&#039;t know that I understand the MTSU situation.  If MTSU needs to cut their budget, it&#039;s because they don&#039;t have enough money.  Students should expect tuition increases if they really want to keep whatever programs they want to keep.  You could cut administrator salaries, but how far will that really get you?  Either the money is there or it isn&#039;t.  You can&#039;t blame the administration for thinking long-term.  Usually the way they do this kind of thing is to drop a given major for incoming freshmen, and then let that work it&#039;s way up over the next three years until the major is completely gone.  Is that not what MTSU is doing?</description>
