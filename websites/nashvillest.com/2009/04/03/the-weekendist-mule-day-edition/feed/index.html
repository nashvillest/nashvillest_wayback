		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll save you a trip about coming to Mule Day.......*DON&#039;T BOTHER*. Don&#039;t bother to come to Columbia for Mule Day unless you own a Mule. I lived in Columbia when I was married and they take Mule Day very seriously.  We didn&#039;t go to any of the festivities but all day saturday would have live broadcasts of the activites on their local access channel such as a &quot;Mule Day&quot; version of softball where the players ride instead of run through the bases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if you think that&#039;s strange........try Old Timer&#039;s Day in Dickson on the first saturday in May. Now that&#039;s strange!]]></description>
