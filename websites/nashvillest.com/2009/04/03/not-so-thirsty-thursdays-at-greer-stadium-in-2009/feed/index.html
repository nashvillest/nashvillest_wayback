		<description><![CDATA[Thirsty Thursday was only a reprieve from normally high drink prices at Greer. If I could get a decent beer for under $5 on any night, I would not miss Trashdy Thursday drink specials. At minor league parks where the beers are priced reasonably - a good  balance is struck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it was, Thursdays were getting a little rough out there. It was an unwelcoming place for any sober baseball fan, especially the kids. That said, it wouldn&#039;t hurt to have fewer chuck-e-cheese nights.]]></description>
