		<description>Just to set the record straight, that article in the Tennessean about the Preds is pretty much bunk. There&#039;s apparently a very confused member of the Sports Council &quot;who wants to know if&quot; and the Tennessean gladly quoted them and added some outright fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The false statement is &quot;because a provision of their lease agreement could give them the ability to leave Nashville next year&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not true. The current lease agreement would only allow them to move if BOTH&lt;br&gt;1) The Predators average under 14,000 in paid attendance for TWO years in a row&lt;br&gt;AND&lt;br&gt;2) The Predators lose a cumulative $20million over the time when the lease was put in place (2007).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How are they doing against those points:&lt;br&gt;1) They averaged over 14,000 in paid attendance last year - so right there that would put the soonest &quot;move out&quot; date at 2011&lt;br&gt;2) They made a small profit in 2007 (didn&#039;t publish what that was) and took a loss of &quot;about $1million&quot; last season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So a nightmare scenario would put the soonest move out date as 2011 (avg less than 14k this year and next and somehow manage to lose $19million in 2 years) and would not allow them to move in 2010 as stated in the article.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lots of us have pointed this out to the Tennessean, but they have yet to post a retraction of the statement. None of us are surprised by the fact.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just to set the record straight, that article in the Tennessean about the Preds is pretty much bunk. There&#39;s apparently a very confused member of the Sports Council &#8220;who wants to know if&#8221; and the Tennessean gladly quoted them and added some outright fiction.</p>
<p>The false statement is &#8220;because a provision of their lease agreement could give them the ability to leave Nashville next year&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not true. The current lease agreement would only allow them to move if BOTH<br />1) The Predators average under 14,000 in paid attendance for TWO years in a row<br />AND<br />2) The Predators lose a cumulative $20million over the time when the lease was put in place (2007).</p>
<p>How are they doing against those points:<br />1) They averaged over 14,000 in paid attendance last year &#8211; so right there that would put the soonest &#8220;move out&#8221; date at 2011<br />2) They made a small profit in 2007 (didn&#39;t publish what that was) and took a loss of &#8220;about $1million&#8221; last season.</p>
<p>So a nightmare scenario would put the soonest move out date as 2011 (avg less than 14k this year and next and somehow manage to lose $19million in 2 years) and would not allow them to move in 2010 as stated in the article.</p>
<p>Lots of us have pointed this out to the Tennessean, but they have yet to post a retraction of the statement. None of us are surprised by the fact.</p>
