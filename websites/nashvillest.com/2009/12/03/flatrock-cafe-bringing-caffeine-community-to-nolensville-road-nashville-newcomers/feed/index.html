		<description>We went to their Grand Opening today. Food is delicious -especially the tomato basil soup. I appreciate the dog-friendly atmosphere, too: I took my two MIniature Schnauzers and sat on the deck, and they were treated like valued customers just like I was.</description>

		<description>I went to the Flatrock Cafe last week (I live in the area) and LOVED it - I knew so many people there and had connections and mutual friends with many more.  It was exhilerating to have this sense of community in my neighborhood.  The chicken salad sandwich was great and I look forward to checking out their coffee and visiting with more friends there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just wanted to correct a statement below- the Flatrock Cafe is not in Brentwood.  It is just a few miles south of downtown Nashville, in the Flatrock (or woodbine) area.  It&#039;s just south of 440 and Nolensville rd.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m so excited about Flatrock Cafe! It fills a void in the Nolensville Rd. area. Their coffee is great, and they have the best cinnamon rolls. It definitely has a community feel to it, the two times I have been there are locals hanging out meeting each other and discussing what is going on the neighborhood!</description>
