		<description><![CDATA[I try not to be Negative Nancy b/c I&#039;m all about some valet parking. But even though it&#039;s a &quot;free&quot; or &quot;complementary&quot; service, you still have to/need to tip the folks, correct?  So then, it&#039;s not really &quot;free&quot; b/c you could&#039;ve saved a couple $$ by parking yourself and walking the few extra feet/yards.  Or maybe I should just start keeping more cash on me to pay for that kind of stuff...?]]></description>
