		<description>I&#039;ve driven the W road in Chattanooga and trust me, it&#039;s better off closed!  It&#039;s the most dangerous road I&#039;ve ever seen.  It usually stays closed for most of the winter anyways.  I&#039;m curious where the rocks ended up though since the road at the bottom is lined with apartment complexes.</description>
