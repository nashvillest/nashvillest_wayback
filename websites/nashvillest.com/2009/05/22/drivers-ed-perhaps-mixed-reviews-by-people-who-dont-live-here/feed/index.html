		<description><![CDATA[I am still blown away by the fact that TN doesnt require driver&#039;s ed to get a license. Even though i know there would be janky &quot;Safe Auto&quot; style &#039;legal for less&#039; classes that would crop up, most kids would probably go ahead and take the real class when they turn 15 like every other state out there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boggles the mind that you have to pass one test when you are 16 yrs old that may or may not even require you to make a left hand turn or parallel park (based on personal and 1st hand accounts from friends) - and you get to operate a lethal piece of heavy machinery for the next...80, 90 years...however long you want. No further certification, education, or testing needed.]]></description>
