		<description>The Veggie Cafe did have location issues, but there was a lot more to it that... the Pied Piper Eatery is doing just fine in the same spot! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming from a vegetarian who is in love with the idea of a dedicated veggie cafe but who never made it to THE Veggie Cafe, I blame not the location, but the weird hours and inconsistent food (both availability and reviews from friends who went - one day it would be great, the next day it was horrible). I probably tried to go there three or four times before I gave up because they were just never open.</description>

		<description>the last veggie cage was not in a good location... 5 points should serve the Green Wagon well. As long as it&#039;s veggie and not vegan. I like me some goat cheese with my veggies... Welcome Green Wagon!</description>
