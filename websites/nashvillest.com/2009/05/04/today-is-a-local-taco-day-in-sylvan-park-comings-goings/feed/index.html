		<description><![CDATA[Really wanted this place to be really good. It wasn&#039;t what I was hoping for!&lt;br&gt; I LOVE mexican and I LOVE margaritas. I go out to have both with my husband at least once a week. Being that we live less than five blocks from LT we were STOKED. Especially when we saw they actually could serve liquor (unlike many other businesses in the area).&lt;br&gt;The tacos were good (interesting choices and fairly cheap), but imagine our disappointment when our SMALL (32 oz) pitcher of margarita was filled to the brim with ice and literally only held a shaker full of pre-mixed margarita. And it cost $18!!!!!&lt;br&gt;HELLO! WHAT? Even though it had a nice flavor it certainly wasn&#039;t worth 18 of my hard earned bucks. What a rip off.&lt;br&gt;I am so disappointed, because my husband and I are all about supporting the local businesses and we would have spent a good amount of our paychecks there this summer if there had been even a little more liquid in that pitcher.&lt;br&gt;Sigh.]]></description>
