		<description>I totally agree that people need to stop &quot;hating&quot; on one part of town over another. Real people live there and we don&#039;t need to make fun of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I lived in the Hickory Hollow area for 2 years (not just Antioch - the Hickory Hollow mall area itself, which is what is being hated on here). It was bad. From what i can tell, not much has changed in the 3 years since. In that time my car was broken in to 3 times and i witnessed a shooting at the mall. And sure all parts of town have weird crimes that happen. It is the routine petty criminal activity that sets Hickory Hollow apart from other parts of town. You can also check here for an interactive crime map-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdmap2.police.nashville.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://pdmap2.police.nashville.org&lt;/a&gt;  (only works in Internet Explorer)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But crime aside, it just isn&#039;t a &quot;nice&quot; part of town. You can&#039;t argue that. Traffic is absolutely horrible (second only to Green Hills i&#039;d say), the mall is going downhill fast in terms of vacancies and the types of stores that are still there, and the area is generally on the downward slide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in saying all of that: That is in no way a judgment about you or anyone else that lives there, and i totally understand being offended by cracks like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But hey, Hickory Hollow ain&#039;t the Ritz.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m kinda tired of everyone hating on Hickory Hollow/Antioch. Sure, there&#039;s some crime here, but what about the old guy that just got beat up at Green Hills? and the other elderly fellow that got the crap pummeled out of him up in Rivergate last week? And I remember a story a year or so ago about a couple of guys found fornicating in the Cool Springs mall I believe it was.&lt;br&gt;No place is immune to these types of incidents; I think there&#039;s an unfair negative image attached to Hickory Hollow</description>
