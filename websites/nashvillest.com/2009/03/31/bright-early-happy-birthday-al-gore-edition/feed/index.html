		<description><![CDATA[Nah, it doesn&#039;t make you an earth-hater. :) I think the point of Earth Hour is less about changing behavior and more about bringing awareness to something. Getting that many folks to cooperate and turn off the lights at the same time was a pretty big feat. Does it make a difference if Al didn&#039;t turn his floodlights off? Probably not. But as a leader of the movement, I guess some folks felt he could&#039;ve made more of an effort.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have met Drew Johnson, and frankly, I don&#039;t like him.  I would say he probably picks and chooses people who will actually receive a good first impression, and I guess I was one of the unlucky ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, and as much as I hate to admit it, he has a point.  If you&#039;re going to preach to the WORLD about saving energy and how important the Earth is, then you better be able to put your money where your mouth is.  If you&#039;re going to talk the talk, then walk the walk.  Otherwise your words are just that--words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man shouldn&#039;t even have floodlights for trees in the first place.  Aren&#039;t they sucking up energy even when it&#039;s not Earth Hour?  Seriously, why do you need to light up your trees?  I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s no Belle Meade ordinance that requires your trees to be illuminated.  And doesn&#039;t it kind of cancel out the environmental impact of the trees themselves with the waste of energy from the lights?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m just sayin&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know this is going to make me an earth-hata but I think this Earth Hour thing was just ridiculous. How many people&#039;s behavior was changed by turning off their lights for one hour? If Al didn&#039;t want to turn off his lights during that particular hour, that&#039;s his right. Maybe he turned them all off today for TWO hours. Does that make him less earth-friendly? Because he didn&#039;t participate in a silly &quot;You Must Do This During This One Hour Or You Are a Kitten Killer&quot; environmental thing...]]></description>
