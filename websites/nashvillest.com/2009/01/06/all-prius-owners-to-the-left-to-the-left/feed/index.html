		<description><![CDATA[I initially thought the same thing, but TN has given out over 1400 tickets for HOV violations this year, which is up from previous years. And honestly, I&#039;d rather have the cops pulling over people who are endangering my life on the road rather than HOV violators... though it sort of invalidates the idea if people don&#039;t obey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m from Virginia and a lot of the HOV lanes there have entrance and exit ramps - they&#039;re separate center lanes with concrete barriers separating them from the regular traffic. They change direction with the time of day, and they have a higher speed limit. They&#039;re also easier to enforce, because people can&#039;t use the HOV lane as a passing lane when it&#039;s set up like that. Our HOV lanes in Nashville are just too tempting, I guess.]]></description>
