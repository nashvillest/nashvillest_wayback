		<description><![CDATA[I forgot to tell you when this was first posted, but the members of Nashville Anonymous were extremely happy to see a photo from one of our protests posted here! Just to let you know, our next anti-Scientology protest is on Valentine&#039;s Day most likely at the intersection of 16th and Edgehill. The Scientologists have purchased two buildings on 8th including the old Falls Business School and we&#039;ve heard from our people on the inside that they&#039;re supposed to be moved in by L. Ron Hubbard&#039;s birthday on 13 March, but they could be moved in before then. It&#039;s up in the air at this moment as to where we&#039;ll be, heh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But yes, thank you! We always appreciate notice :D!]]></description>
