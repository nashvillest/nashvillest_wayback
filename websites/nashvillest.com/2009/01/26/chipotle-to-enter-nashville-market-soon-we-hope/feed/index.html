		<description><![CDATA[Did anyone know that FLEX actually noted this franchise being voted on by bodybuilders as one of the top healthiest places to eat in America? And it&#039;s good for all economic conditions. I ate there alot when I lived in Denver. Sorry but people have been mislead by BAJA Burrito, you can actually eat healthy and still have taste. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PLEASE OPEN A CHIPOTLE IN NASHVILLE!  VANDY AREA... or GREEN HILLS (HILL CENTER) ...  those are the absoulte best areas of traffic for this type of food.  I have been to the ones in CA..and they are absolutely great!  BETTER THAN MOES, BAJA FRESH, QDOBA (which to me is a substandard Chipotle) and BLUE COAST BURRITOS (which are becoming very popular and spreading, but CHIPOTLE is still better!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bellevue is supposedly building a outdoor mall similar to the one in Carlsbad CA, that may be a good place also...but I think better in the VANDY &amp; GREEN HILLS AREA...money galore!]]></description>
