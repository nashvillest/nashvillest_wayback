		<description><![CDATA[You know, I&#039;m not entirely sure. We assumed that the entire store was an Expo store but it looks like it might just be part of it. Thanks for pointing that out, we&#039;ll edit the language of the post to be less definitive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hillsboro Hardware store is an option.  It&#039;s just south of the Harris Teeter at 21st and Blair.  There&#039;s also a hardware store on Nolensville a little bit south of Thompson Lane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it&#039;s fascinating that the little guys somehow managed to outlive the big Home Depot when it comes to the mid-South Nashville area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah, and I think there are a couple Ace Hardwares around, if they&#039;re still open.  One in Green Hills and the other near Harding and White Bridge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me it reads like it&#039;s just the adjacent &quot;Expo&quot; store that is closing, not the Home Depot itself. Am I missing something?]]></description>
