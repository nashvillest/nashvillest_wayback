		<description><![CDATA[I think the main goal at the &#039;wagon&#039; is to promote and offer additional green and sustainable alternatives to some of the purchases we make. I would take pride in being compared to a &#039;Whole Foods&#039;, there should be more choices for locally &#039;green&#039; consumers and The Green Wagon is one! 
P.S.  Many &quot;experts&quot; do not make the commitment to living green themselves, much less use earth friendly fuel.  If I had a question about being more green, I&#039;d probably ask Jennifer.
