		<description>I haven&#039;t been to Rosario&#039;s in a year, but every time I went last summer, there were gnats flying around INSIDE that wouldn&#039;t leave us (or our food) alone...  also, i know someone who found a roach in their food, reported it, and the waiter shrugged it off.  Her meal wasn&#039;t even comp&#039;ed!   Just needed to vent.  sorry. :)</description>
