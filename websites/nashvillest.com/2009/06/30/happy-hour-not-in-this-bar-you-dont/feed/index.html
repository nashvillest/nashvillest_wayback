		<description>Was the permit holder drunk when they took their safety course?  The reason the bill is asking for trouble is because it allows them to carry a gun while drunk.</description>

		<description>Oh dear, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can see the argument for the gun enthusiasts but the liberal side of me thinks Nashville drunks with guns can only lead to disaster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside, I doubt Sunset Grill has many &quot;Armed Thugs&quot; entering its doors. Most of the crime that occurs in that part of town is meth heads breaking into people&#039;s cars for a quick buck. (they drive there cause they know where the money is).</description>

		<description>Those poor naive bar &amp; restaurant owners.  They don&#039;t know that people have been bringing unregistered guns into their establishment for years.  That&#039;s right.  On any given night, you WILL have a REAL criminal sitting at one of those seats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those poor naive bar &amp; restaurant owners don&#039;t understand that someone with a permit is the LEAST likely person to cause a problem in their place of business.  Someone with a permit has taken and passed a gun safety course.  They&#039;ve had their criminal background checked, their weapon is registered and so have their fingerprints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare that to the armed thug who&#039;s been coming in to their place for years, who&#039;s doing it now, and and who will continue to do so in defiance of the law.</description>
