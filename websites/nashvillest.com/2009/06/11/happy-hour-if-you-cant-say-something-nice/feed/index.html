		<description>Heh, Swine Flu.. it&#039;s still spreading like wildfire... It&#039;s really bad in Australia. But woooosshhh. American media doesn&#039;t cover it so it doesn&#039;t exist. I wish there would be like, an environmental scare or a hunger scare... We could get so much accomplished if the media spent a fraction of the effort they showed the swine flu.</description>
