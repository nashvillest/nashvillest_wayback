		<description>After reading the source story on the poisoned fish... I am led to believe it was intentional, in an attempt to de-toxify the ponds, not accidental, right? Either way, it&#039;s a waste. But to tell the truth,  I would have loved to see what all floated up.</description>

		<description>Well if CMApocalypse and Bonnaroo aren&#039;t enough, there are as many (if not more) people at Riverbend in Chattanooga that started Friday and runs all the way through this coming Saturday.  I was there to see Train Saturday night and there was definitely no shortage of people.</description>
