		<description>The thing about the Country music lovers not having internet... well, it&#039;s a tab deeper than that. I actually have every single page of that Nielsen research report and it&#039;s very interesting. Yes, there is that percentage that doesn&#039;t have internet and doesn&#039;t care to, but it&#039;s QUICKLY shrinking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#039;s also easy to pass judgement on that 42% and on Country fans in general for not wanting to embrace new technology, but that&#039;s not really it at all. Many, many people who cite Country as their favorite type of music live far from major metropolis&#039; and the cost of getting regular internet access is just too expensive right now. Sure there are satellite internet providers, but the cost on those are still just a bit out of reach for many of those who say Country is their favorite. Add in the price of the computer, the router, etc... well, many people just find the expense daunting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Times are changing though. That number shrinks every month. Country fans, while typically slow to embrace the newest technology, are getting more and more savvy.</description>
