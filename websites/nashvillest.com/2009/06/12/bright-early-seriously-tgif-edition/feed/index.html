		<description>On &quot;Lake Palmer&quot;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This pit has been sitting there for years now.  I use to work right next to it, we called it the &quot;Lakes of Westend.&quot;  At first they were trying to keep the water out by pumping it into the sewer system, the city stopped them from doing so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last summer the mosquitoes were horrible and there was also concern about the lack of any real security around the pit (just a simple chain link fence with gates often left open).  We emailed the health department about the concern for public safety and the bug problem.  They responded saying they went out and saw no risk to public health...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe in a few more years they will change their minds.</description>
