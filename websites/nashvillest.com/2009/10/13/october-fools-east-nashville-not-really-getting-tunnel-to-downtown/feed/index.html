		<description>Isn&#039;t the &quot;crime-free West side&quot; where the guy was grabbing womens&#039; butts on Belmont Blvd and where Christy F(r)ink got her computer stolen out of her house? Out of touch people live everywhere. Crime happens everywhere. What can you do? [shrug]</description>

		<description>East Nashville people are not only out of touch with reality, they lack humor and personality.  Let them have their ugly ass part of town.  I&#039;ll be over here in the crime-free West side.</description>

		<description>This just goes to show you how completely out of touch with reality my neighbors are, and why I had to unsubscribe from the listserv. Man oh man.</description>

		<description>It saddens me that even one single person -- east Nashvillian or otherwise -- needed this wonderfully absurd joke explained to them. Makes you wonder if they&#039;d laugh at a Steven Wright show, or if his deadpan style would confuse them into believing he was delivering important news from the government.</description>
