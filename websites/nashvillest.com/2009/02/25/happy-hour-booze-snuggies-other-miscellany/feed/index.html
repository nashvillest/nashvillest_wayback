		<description><![CDATA[You are right about one thing, Christy. There is no crawl on the 5th. It&#039;s been moved up to this Saturday! Yeah! Nashville is #2 in history of the Snuggie Pub Crawl. &lt;a href=&quot;http://SnuggiePubCrawls.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SnuggiePubCrawls.com&lt;/a&gt; because there&#039;s more to a crawl than Ol&#039; Chicago :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stay Cozy and Stay Classy, Christy. Say hi to your Chicago buds for me. Perhaps they should have kept their original date instead of &#039;allowing more time for people&#039;s Snuggie orders to come in through their website&#039;. While you follow suit, trying to monetize this, the Snuggie Pub Crawl train has left the station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You either make history, or you are history, left simply to report on it after the fact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No crawl on the 5th! Another snuggie crawl website decided to compete with the existing one and someone scheduled one for that day, except they apparently have no one organizing it. So, don&#039;t pay attention to it (they&#039;re also hounding people on Twitter) and stay tuned for the real deal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard the crawl would be on March 5. Please say it ain&#039;t so! That&#039;s the boyfriend&#039;s birthday and this won&#039;t be his idea of a celebration. Plus, you gotta give people time to buy their Snuggies or Slankets (which I have now nicknamed &quot;Smuggies&quot; because, you know, they&#039;re better than Snuggies).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incidentally, I love my Slanket too much to take it to a pub. I&#039;ll be wearing a robe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, but would a ROBE pub crawl be nearly as much fun as a SNUGGIE pub crawl?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a more personal note, I&#039;m a fan of the robe-in-lieu-of-pants thing. We probably should never have changed that.]]></description>
