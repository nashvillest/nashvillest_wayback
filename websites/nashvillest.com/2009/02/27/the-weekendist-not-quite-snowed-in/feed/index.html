		<description><![CDATA[We heard about this! We&#039;re actually holding out on this one and organizing a bigger crawl in April. The folks who headed this one up, though first, are using their site to spam and rake in ad revenues from Snuggie, which we don&#039;t support. Feel free to take your Snuggie there, but keep an ear out for the date on ours to be announced soon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m quite glad you mentioned the Preds v Red Wings game. It is close to selling out, but there are some tickets left. It&#039;s gonna be a lot of fun, although I&#039;d like to mention one other great event going on Saturday night you didn&#039;t mention. Nashville local favorite Indie Rock band Lórien is having a CD release show at 12th and Porter starting at 8pm. Their new album Esque is going to be released, and you can of course find more information at their Myspace, &lt;a href=&quot;http://myspace.com/lorien&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://myspace.com/lorien&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
