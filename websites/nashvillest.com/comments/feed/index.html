		<description>crawfish boil. 

Yes, there apparently were crawlfish at the crawlfish boil, but the tent was extremely hard to find. This is not your typical crawlfish boil either. Most crawlfish boil consists of people leisurely enjoying boiling crawlfish, drinking beer and enjoying each other's company, a typical southern tradition. Usually a Lacoste polo and a sorority girl is thrown in the mix. Well, not Nashville's Crawlfish Boil. Apparently it is a rock concert.  Lastnight's  boil headlined "Three Door's Down" who entertained the crowd with their wonderful original "Superman" and cool background graphics of Window's 95 flying Kryptonight. Also was not expecting "Pop a Roach" (will not even go into why a band is named such a thing) . Thus to say in the very least I was extremely surprised at the crowds, young and old (5-75 yrs) head banging their half-drunk selves away (well hopefully not the children) when all I really wanted was some seafood. So Nashville you have surprised me once again. And the festival is continuing on today with headlining Nashville's (franklin) own Paramore.</description>

		<description>Hi, just a note: The Ren Fest is not in Murfreesboro, it's in Arrington (or Triune--is that part of Arrington now?). I live in Murfreesboro and it's about a 25-30 min. trip to the festival grounds for me if I take 96. 

I'll be interested to read y'all's review of the pirate invasion!</description>
