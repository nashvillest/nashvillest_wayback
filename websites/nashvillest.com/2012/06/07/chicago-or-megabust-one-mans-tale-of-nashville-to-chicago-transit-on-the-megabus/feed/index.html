		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve taken the BoltBus (same idea, different company) between Philly/NYC and NYC/Baltimore.  The boarding process is hectic - can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s much different than boarding a long haul bus in Rio or Mumbai - but once you&#039;re on the bus it was fine.  Really, really inexpensive if you plan ahead, aren&#039;t in a rush and can deal with their schedule.  When we used it, BoltBus was around 75% less than Amtrak.  We didn&#039;t have any problems with delays or bus maintenance.  The wifi was less than stellar, but that&#039;s probably to be expected.  Good luck in Chicago!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Took the megabus up to Chi a month or so ago.  He will be on a single decker bus not a double. Mine broke down in Indy for a few hours on the way back but other than that was a good experience.  I wouldn&#039;t take it if I were on a tight time schedule.  ]]></description>
