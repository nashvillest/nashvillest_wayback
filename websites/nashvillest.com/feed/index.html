<p style="text-align: left;">Good morning, Nashville. Though the <a href="http://www.wsmv.com/news/25436729/detail.html" target="_blank">Titans practically gutted the Jaguars last night 30-3</a>, the game wasn&#8217;t without a casualty: <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101018/SPORTS01/101018050/-1/RSS05" target="_blank">Vince Young left in the first quarter after we all watched his knee do something that knees shouldn&#8217;t do</a>. Kerry Collins took over for the rest of the game and despite VY&#8217;s sprained knee and ankle, Coach Fisher said he could&#8217;ve returned. So apparently it wasn&#8217;t as bad as it looked. Oh, and while we&#8217;re discussing the Titans, <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101018/SPORTS01/101018035/-1/RSS05" target="_blank">Albert Haynesworth probably ain&#8217;t coming back</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Early voting turnout. </strong>According to election officials, <a href="http://www.wsmv.com/news/25432989/detail.html" target="_blank">more than 150,000 Tennesseans have shown up to the polls during the first four days of early voting</a>. The early voting period continues through October 28th, so <a href="http://www.nashville.gov/vote/upcoming_elec/2010/early_101102.asp" target="_blank">find out where you can vote and go there</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Happy endings.</strong> Remember a few months ago when a contractor accidentally deleted hundreds of dashboard cam recordings that Metro actually needed for evidence in DUI cases and such? <a href="http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/audit-technology-upgrade-likely-blame-deleted-car-videos?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">A recent audit found that a &#8220;technology upgrade&#8221; was to blame</a> and that <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13345091" target="_blank">most of them can be recovered</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Bits &amp; pieces.</strong> <a href="http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/downtown-streets-close-music-city-center-construction?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">More roads are shutting down</a> for Music City Center construction &#8230; Once upon a time, <a href="http://www.wsmv.com/news/25430123/detail.html" target="_blank">a Bellevue family had their flood-damaged home gutted without anyone telling them about it</a> &#8230; No, the <a href="http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/ignore-speculation-mlb-interested-nashville?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-CityNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+City+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">Tampa Bay Devil Rays are not coming to Nashville</a> &#8230; <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101019/SPORTS02/10190338/-1/RSS05" target="_blank">Pekka could be back on the ice today</a> &#8230; Our inner six-year olds are jumping for joy that <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101019/NEWS01/10190330/-1/RSS05" target="_blank">MASTODON BONES were probably uncovered in Franklin</a>.</li>

<li>Counterfeit cash is becoming a bigger problem in Franklin lately. Most of it is turning up in the form of fake $100 bills that someone is using to pay small bills and receive as much real change as possible.

<li>Tennessee (and everyone else in the country) is actively seeking out some more college graduates with science degrees to fill all of these high-tech jobs that are vacant because everyone wants to be a rockstar instead.

<p style="text-align: left;">Good morning, Nashville. Local cyclists are complaining that <a href="http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/sewer-grates-across-city-dangerous-cyclists?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NashvilleCityPaper-LatestNews+(Nashville+City+Paper+-+Latest+News)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">Metro isn&#8217;t responding quickly enough to the need to replace non-bike-friendly storm drains that have caused serious accidents around the city</a>. Grates whose openings are parallel to the streets can swallow up bike tires and cause cyclists to flip over their handlebars, as has happened in the past and resulted in some pretty hefty lawsuits against Metro. And although some of the grates have been replaced with others that have slats facing perpendicular to the street, there are still enough of the parallel grates to cause a problem.</p>

<li>The IRS will be auctioning off Young Buck&#8217;s things at the end of the month to pay off all of the money he owes them for taxes. And many of these things sound like they could be very useful! Such as: &#8220;pictures of Al Pacino and rapper Tupac, a “marijuana leaf picture”, three Royal Copenhagen white bear figurines and a 3-foot white and silver Santa Claus decoration.&#8221; [<a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101014/NEWS03/101014046/-1/RSS05" target="_blank">Tennessean</a>]</li>
<li>Here are a bunch of old Starwood Amphitheater pictures to make you feel old if you recognize them, young if you don&#8217;t, or really young if you&#8217;re wondering what a Starwood is. [<a href="http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Site=DN&amp;Date=20070213&amp;Category=TUNEIN&amp;ArtNo=702130807&amp;Ref=PH" target="_blank">Tennessean</a>]</li>
<li>Belmont broke ground on their fancy new law school today, which is expected to start rollin&#8217; in 2011. [<a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101014/NEWS01/101014085/-1/RSS05" target="_blank">Tennessean</a>]</li>
<li>MTSU recently conducted a poll to explore how Tennesseans feel towards Muslims. The good news is that 2/3rds of the folks polled said they should have the same religious rights as the rest of us. The bad news is that 1/3 of the respondents said that Muslims should be required to register their whereabouts with the government.

<p style="text-align: left;">Good morning, Nashville. <a href="http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=13320408" target="_blank">Local teachers are afraid that text lingo may be getting in the way of our kids learning the English language</a>. With text speak working its way into conversation in real life (IRL), it stands to reason that it has also been showing up in kids&#8217; papers and projects for school. English language expert and University School of Nashville teacher Robert McKay especially worries that all of this shorthand is hurting the art of language and the importance of spelling.</p>

<li><strong>Something stinks.</strong> Not only do we have bedbugs and brown recluses to worry about this year, <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=13318466" target="_blank">but an exotic species of stinkbug has also moved into Middle Tennessee. From China</a>! Outside of their nasty odor, bug experts fear they could also be bad for crops.</li>

<p>A crowd of 500+ folks (Super Swarm badge, anyone?) making their way to Cadillac Ranch on Broadway this Saturday (before 8am, no less) may look confusing at first, but if you look closely, you&#8217;ll probably notice more than a few laptops and smartphones in the crowd. The reason for the massive group of technology fiends descending on lower Broad? BarCamp Nashville, an annual &#8220;unconference&#8221; put on by geeks, for geeks. At an unconference like BarCamp, any attendee can pitch in to help plan, volunteer or hold a session during the day &#8211; and what you end up with is a free new media conference with a diverse range of topics, opinions and expertise.</p>
<p>This year, attendees have already been busy creating nearly 50 sessions about online branding and marketing, web development, best business practices and of course, everyone&#8217;s old favorite, <em>social media</em>. <a href="http://www.barcampnashville.org/bcn10/sessions/all" target="_blank">Check out the sessions</a>, pick what strikes your fancy, and join us at Cadillac Ranch this Saturday to start learning! (If you forget to <a href="http://www.barcampnashville.org/bcn10/user/register" target="_blank">register online</a>, you can do so at the door.)</p>
<p>Are you skimming this post because you&#8217;re already experienced in the ways of BarCamp? We&#8217;ve got a few things for you too, so listen up.</p>
<ol>
<li>We hear that the BarCamp crew is still in need of a few volunteers (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)! Contact <a href="http://www.barcampnashville.org/bcn10/users/sambradleytn" target="_blank">Sam Bradley</a> to lend a hand.</li>
<li><a href="http://chrisennis.tumblr.com/post/1293176904/a-social-app-for-barcamp" target="_blank">Go scheduling pro with BCN Social</a>, an online social scheduling tool that lets you find out where your friends are via Twitter and texts you throughout the day to tell you where and when your next session is happening.</li>
<li>All good lists have three points.</li>
</ol>
<p>Experienced BarCamper or not, be sure to <a href="http://www.barcampnashville.org/bcn10/news/feeding-our-minds-and-our-community" target="_blank">bring a can or two of food to donate to Second Harvest Food Bank</a>.</p>
<p>Still on the fence? Would an afterparty with some free Yazoo help you make up your mind? (Yeah, we thought so too.)</p>
<p><strong>BarCamp Nashville, Saturday, October 16 at Cadillac Ranch (305 Broadway).<br />
</strong><em>Registration starts at 7:30am, sessions run from 8am to 4:20pm, and the afterparty starts at 5. </em></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been waiting for years for the Pinkberry-in-Nashville rumors to come to fruition, and it&#8217;s finally time &#8211; Nashville&#8217;s first Pinkberry opens this Thursday, and there will be free samples for everyone at their grand opening celebration! Whether you&#8217;re loyal to one of our many local fro-yo alternatives or a longtime Pinkberry enthusiast, who can resist free treats?</p>
<p>Pinkberry will open at <strong>2306 West End Avenue</strong> (the old Blockbuster location) on <strong>Thursday, October 14 from 6-10pm</strong>. Anyone who stops by will receive a FREE sample of frozen yogurt to snack on while enjoying the games, music and other fun at the grand opening shindig.</p>
